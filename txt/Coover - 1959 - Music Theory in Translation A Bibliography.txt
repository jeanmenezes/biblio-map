is bi-dimensional,
that the compiler

and could serve adequately
though the resultant list is comprehensive
as a basis for a number of future studies, it is still not overlong. It is,
in its brevity. (Such a public display of paucity, howin fact,depressing
ever, may be desirable at this point, both in order to demonstrate the
needs and to encourage potential translators to supply them.)
Following somewhat flexible over-all criteria in collecting citations for this bibliography,
I have, nevertheless,

trarily, I have included, as well, a few of the more famous works on
musical practice whose import, it seems to me, extends beyond the
of music, back to its actual creationperformance, or re-creation,
specifically works which were, at the time they were in circulation and
wide use, valuable guides, not only for performers,
but also for those
who labored to comprehend and organize the raw materials of music,
the composers.
The list includes, therefore, C. P. E. Bach, Couperin,
Tosi and
Frescobaldi,
Turk, and others on keyboard performance,
Carissimi on singing, and Tartini and Leopold Mozart on violin-playing,
but excluded are most treatises
on interpretation and ornamentation.

and complete translations
of long but pedestrian tracts,
or that of
balancing partly-summarized,

translations of long but unmomentous treatises, I have solved as simply
as possible, merely by including the majority of each-a
cavalier and
criticizable way of resolving perplexities,
perhaps, but one which prevents dilution or diminution of the intended comprehensiveness
of this
survey. But as a consequence, the user is apt to find a few items listed
which were perhaps better ignored.
He is free, of course, to do so.
Additions tothis list or corrections of items already included will
be welcomed by both the editor and myself.
Truly, the absence from
the bibliography of works by theorists of unquestioned stature, such as
Zacconi, Werckmeister,
de Beldemandis,

the theoretical "Denkmaler"-perhaps
will be measurably brightened.
Indeed, we might even hope that the
rate of translation soon will be so great that within a few years this
guide will be totally obsolete.
A few words are neededhere
of the list.

respecting

the format and mechanics

I have utilized fully the resources
1. Sources.
of the Vassar
Library, of course, and whenever possible have examined carefully
e,ach item listed below. But many citations have been drawn from common secondary sources-encyclopedias
(Groves, Fetis), library catalogues (Boston, British Museum, Library of Congress), private library
catalogues (Cortot, Wolffheim), current lists in periodicals and annuals
(NOTES, Jahrbuch... Peters, Acta, the Music Index), standard histories
(Reese MMA and MR, Lang), and standard bibliographies
(Forkel,
The opportunity to examine more theoretical
Becker, Lichtenthal).
works in English, and to compare more of them with the older foreign
language treatises would surely yield additional information about what
has been translated and/or paraphrased where and by whom, but such
a sophisticated
detective job is, more appropriately,
a second step,
while this effort-predominantly
a search of the secondary sources-is
a natural, initial one.
2. Bases for translations cited. For almost every translation, I
have tried to note the supposed title and date of the work from which
the English version was prepared; in the case of those treatises included in Coussemaker and Gerbert's Scriptores,
even citations of the
pages covered have been given. I say "supposed"' for often translators
are not explicit about which manuscript or edition they have used, and
though an attempt was made to secure thorough documentation whenever
it was impossible to collate a particular translation with all the possible
sources for it, in a few instances,
documentation was completely lacking, and the work which is noted as the original may be incorrect or
the wrong edition of the original.
For works before 1900 and for works which I con3. Variants.
sider extremely important, I have tried to set out in detail all variant
editions of the extant English translations,
but for lesser works (e. g.
