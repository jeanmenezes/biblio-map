ABSTRACT
	
	

This work documents a design-led process of discovery for artistic development

of real time 3D animations functioning as a visual extension to a live music performance.
Musical dynamics, patterns, and themes are transposed into a visual form that develops
over time through a carefully orchestrated process driven by the artist and the computer.
Historical animations by Fischinger, Whitney, and “light organ” projections by Wilfred
inform the work’s conceptual development. Various systems automate camera controls,
audio analysis, and layers of motion in addition to providing the artist with a unique set
of controls that demonstrate the effectiveness of the computer as a visual instrument for
the artist. The complete system balances artistic responses, live multi-channel audio
input, and computer control systems to orchestrate a real time visualization of a live
music performance. The artist’s sensibilities and the computer’s generative capabilities
combine to create a visually-focused member in the performing music ensemble.

INTRODUCTION

	

Music is a unique artistic form of expression. It has incredible power to inspire

emotion, whisk one away to imaginary worlds, and envelop an audience in a temporal
and sonic experience that is unlike any other art form. Music constantly changes,
grows, and recedes in intensity as it develops over time. As a temporal medium, music
is restricted to the continuous passing of time, or as Horton Presley eloquently noted,
“music is by nature a momentary experience. The note sounds and is gone.” (Presley 9).
Music requires the advancement of time whereas a painting or sculpture can be enjoyed
or analyzed for any period of time. Visualizing music provides an alternate medium that
can capture a brief snapshot or history of a music performance.
	

Now imagine if this visual medium could capture and display this essence

of time, sonic decay, or a snapshot of the ever-changing intensity that exists in a
music performance. Visualizing music could illustrate the initial attack of a note and
its entire decay into silence within a single visual form. How might this visual form
take shape? How could an artist use compositional space and time in an animation to
illustrate this auditory experience? How would one design a visual language system
that could effectively interpret and display this performance in a visual manner? The
work documented in this paper explores some of these possibilities by incorporating
3D computer animation as a visual extension to a live music performance. These visual
investigations stress the importance of the music as the predominant and controlling
1

factor throughout the development phases of the animation.
	

Dynamics are an integral part of a live performance and they create a unique

and constantly changing variable during the performance. Just as music permeates a
performance space, corresponding changes in positive and negative space within a visual
composition create a powerful unity between the two different mediums. The use of
visual space and how it conveys the dynamics in a performance is an important factor in
the creation of these visualizations. Understanding and exploring this relationship is one
of the aspirations for my work in music visualizations.
	

As a classically trained musician, themes in music define the composer’s concept

for the piece. These elements can illustrate how a composer developed his or her ideas in
a piece of music, and they are important elements that I consider when listening to music.
I understand how integral these thematic elements are to a music composition, but how
could they influence my visual design process? Can themes in music successfully transfer
to the visual animation? Can the structure and development process associated with
composing a piece of music inform and embellish the structure of a visual animation?
These explorations in music visualizations seek to demonstrate the effective use of
relating music themes to specific visual forms in the animation. The guiding influence
of themes and patterns in music as they relate to visual forms in the animation is another
critical component to my work.
	

The system that enables these relationships to take place between music and

visuals is another critical component to the music visualizations. Providing the artist
with a unique tool set, this system contains a hierarchy of controls that allows the artist
to visually manipulate incoming audio data and visually construct an animation. This
system presents the artist with an open canvas for drawing relationships between musical
elements and visual forms. These musical and visual explorations expand the boundaries
of a computer as a content creation tool to elevate the computer to a companion role
2

with the artist in the execution of the real-time animations. The computer’s function as a
visual instrument for the artist is enhanced through the elaborate system of controls. This
system balances the efficient data management and analysis capabilities of the computer
with the artist’s adaptive sensibilities. The hierarchy of control systems is designed to
accommodate both entities’ strengths. During the live performance, the system unites the
computer and the artist. The computer becomes a visual instrument for the artist to play
and the artist works in tandem with the performing musicians to create a 3D visualization
that reacts to the live music performance. The artist and the computer can respond to each
other and the music performance to create an animation that is a unique collaboration of
all three entities involved.
	

This thesis documents this development process and discusses some of the

conceptual ramifications of such a system. How much control should be allotted to the
computer? How can the artist maintain a strong conceptual voice in the execution of the
animation when timing becomes a critical factor? Can a system be created that caters to
each of the strengths of the artist and computer? What controls would be most intuitive
for the artist, and what control systems should the computer manage? These questions are
addressed and discussed throughout the development of my work.

1.1 Methodology
	

This work documents and executes the process of designing real-time animations

that function as visual extensions to music. The three areas of interest include music
dynamics, interpretation of musical themes, and computer and artistic control, each
of which is addressed in documentation of the design and development process. A
historical account of previous explorations in music visualizations presents a conceptual
and inspirational framework for precedents in the artistic and design decisions used to
construct the music-driven animations. The works studied include abstract paintings,
3

abstract films, and performance-based installations that exemplify the use of color,
motion, space, and time to represent relationships between visual forms and music. My
explorations into the field of music visualizations spans from theory-based animations
that depict complex patterns in music, to abstract, dynamic animations that strive to
emulate the enveloping qualities of a live music performance. A chronological and
conceptual accounting describes my processes, trials, and tribulations. Reflection,
introspection, and critical analysis of my work are provided as I continue to develop new
methods and build on successes from prior music animations. My work is constantly
evolving and my methods continue to change. These changes are documented to
reflect my growth as an artist in pursuit of creating a significant visual artwork that
can accompany a great music performance. The documentation of these chronological
investigations addresses three principle topics that are the guiding force for the music
visualizations:
•	 The use of compositional space and its relationship to music dynamics
•	 The influence and guidance of themes, patterns, and motifs in music
•	 The transforming of the computer from a tool for media production to a real-time
instrument in which the creation process occurs as part of the live music animation
performance.

1.2 Design Challenges
	

The design challenges this project faces range from artistic and conceptual

problem-solving to complex technical hurdles that must be overcome to create realtime music visualizations. Conceptual solutions include the choice of forms best suited
to represent a musical theme or the use of visuals that effectively convey the range of
dynamics in a music performance. Music performances contain an extensive range of
dynamics. Performers can play so quietly that an audience may struggle to hear the
4

music or they can blast their instruments with tremendous weight and piercing qualities
to the sound. The visual component needs to support this potential dynamic range. The
selection of visual forms and appropriate use of compositional space needs to exhibit
these dynamic qualities in music. If a piece of music is reaching its climactic moment,
the animation needs to visually support this. Color choices and the use of space need
to be considered and judged on their relationship to prior moments in the music and
the animation. In addition to the influence of music dynamics, musical themes are
informative to the artistic decision-making process because a musical theme represents
the core concept for the piece of music. Composers will state, develop, and use variations
on a theme throughout the entire piece of music. Choosing appropriate visual imagery
or motion to represent a musical theme presents a unique challenge. This choice needs
to support the growth and recession of dynamics in the music, and it must relate and
develop in tandem with the musical theme. This will help facilitate the ultimate goal of
the work which is to visually support the music.
	

The technical challenges involve creating a system that is capable of responding

to a live music performance. This system needs to provide an accurate audio analysis,
manage large amounts of data, manipulate this data according to an artist’s definitions,
and generate 3D animation on a screen within a real time environment. Response time
is a critical factor for creating the perception that the visualization is responding to
the live audio inputs. This real-time animation system will also need to balance the
controllable parameters between the artist and the computer. The novel approach of this
system permits the computer to make decisions during the creation and execution of
the animation. This programmed ability needs to be balanced with the artist’s control
so that both entities work together to create an animation that is responsive to the music
performance. All of these challenges are addressed throughout the development of my
work and they are continually improved as my work evolves.
5

	

The experience of this work in a live performance setting and how it visually

conveys the music to the audience is another important challenge. The delivery of the
animation needs to be seamless and integrated with the overall performance environment.
I do not want to expose the audience to technical limitations that exist in a real-time
animation environment. Therefore, the visualizations need to maintain a fluidic motion
and acceptable frame rate in the 3D animation, orchestrate camera motions that do not
make viewers feel sea sick or severely disoriented, and appropriate high contrast imagery
so the projected animation is clearly visible to the audience. The projected animation
will compete with stage lighting on the musicians and ambient light that is present in any
performance hall environment, so choosing high contrast imagery and colors is a factor
that needs to be considered in the design phase of the animation. The logistics of screen
positioning relative to the performers and installation of necessary equipment needs
to be considered so that the visualization will blend with the performance space. The
consideration of all these elements helps to create a unified and immersive environment
that connects the visual experience to the music performance. It allows the audience to
become enveloped in the visual component of the performance in much the same way
the music envelops the space and the auditory senses. The synchronization between the
animation and the music performance, combined with a seamless environment between
the visual and auditory components creates an experience that reinforces the conceptual
challenge of creating a music visualization that supports, enhances, and illustrates a live
music performance through the use of 3D computer animation.

CHAPTER 2

ARTISTIC EXPLORATION AND MUSIC DISCUSSION WITHIN MUSIC
VISUALIZATIONS

	

Music exemplifies expressive, structural, and emotive qualities that artists have

sought to imbue in their works. Artists like Wassily Kandinsky believed that music had
a direct emotional connection to the human soul and by creating visual art that emulated
music, one could create a sensual experience that would yield a spiritual awakening
(Brougher 31). Kandinsky wrote a treatise On the Spiritual in Art in 1911 that discussed
the creation of synaesthetic works.
	
Color is the keyboard. The eye is the hammer. The soul is the
piano, with its many strings. The artist is the hand that purposefully sets
the soul vibrating by means of this or that key. Thus it is clear that the
harmony of colors can only be based upon the principle of purposefully
touching the human soul. (Brougher 31)
Kandinsky’s paintings used a rhythmic interplay of geometric forms and color in an
attempt to create a truly synaesthetic painting (Brougher 24). His work and the treatise
he wrote inspired the works of other painters like Frantisek Kupka, Paul Klee, and
Georgia O’Keeffe. Kupka’s Disks of Newton (Study for “Fugue in Two Colors”) (1912)
was inspired by Sir Isaac Newton’s color wheel and many of his works were titled after
musical terminology (Brougher 38). Paul Klee considered polyphony, or multiple voices
in music, a unique model for color gradations and compositional arrangements in his
paintings (Brougher 57). O’Keeffe listened to music while drawing and painting, and
she was a proponent of the idea that music could be translated into something for the
7

eye (Brougher 59). One of her works, Blue and Green Music (1921) represents her own
ethereal visualization of music. All of these artists used visual forms and specific color
choices to illustrate music in their own unique way. Their work has influenced my study
and conceptual direction for associating music dynamics with the size and space of visual
forms. The works of these painters strive to create a heightened emotional response in the
viewer by linking musical inspiration to their creation process. My music visualizations
attempt to create a similar heightened response from the audience by using music as the
foundation for my project development.

2.1 The use of visual form and space in relationship to music dynamics
	

The music is the primary source for my inspiration and its constantly evolving

nature creates a unique opportunity for exploration in visualization. A music performance
is a one-of-a-kind event that cannot be perfectly replicated. The musicians cannot
perform exactly as they did the night before, and a recording cannot perfectly replicate
the experience of the live performance. All of these variables and variations that are
inherent in a music performance present exciting opportunities for visualization. My
work consistently refers and relates back to the music, providing the foundation for
my visual work. The systems I develop and the visual forms I create are inspired and
derived from subtle nuances, structural patterns, and stylistic interpretations that exist in
a music performance. The works created for this thesis are not just artistic interpretations
of music, but are visual extensions that strive to capture the dynamic interplay between
musicians and structural patterns for the music being performed. As a musician and
artist, I have a unique perspective on how visual form may take shape as informed by the
complexities of a music performance.
	

My choice to associate the size of visual forms with the dynamic qualities of

music is heavily influenced by previous works in music visualization and from an
8

instinctual perception that larger objects tend to emit louder sounds. Kandinsky writes in
his 1911 treatise On the Spiritual in Art:
“Finally, our hearing of colors is so precise that is would perhaps be
impossible to find anyone who would try to represent his impression of
bright yellow by means of the bottom register of the piano.” (Brougher 32)
Kandinsky suggests that it would not be successful to associate bright, happy colors
with lower notes or use dark, bold, and heavy colors to represent the higher pitches of
a musical instrument. In the same gesture, it would seem contrary to represent a loud
sound with a very small visual form or a very quiet sound with a large visual form. The
correlation between visual size and loudness relates to an instinctual and survival nature
in humans. Humans instinctively associate louder sounds with something that is closer,
bigger, or more powerful. This relationship originates from theories of perception for
survival and it is a critical factor in the evolution of humans (Proctor).
	

Dynamics play a critical role in music and their constant variability holds

incredible opportunities for artistic exploration. Dynamics are often relative, and their
role in a music performance is subject to the performer’s interpretation. In order to
convey this, it is important to understand how dynamics are portrayed from a musician’s
viewpoint. It is also important to my process when considering appropriate visual forms
and their relative sizes. Certain styles and instrumentations of music such as Classical
music or jazz ensembles exemplify a different kind of dynamic range when compared to
Rock ‘n Roll music or a heavy metal band. My understanding of how dynamics relate to
musicians allows me to better articulate this element in my visualizations.
	

Music dynamics are typically notated in written music by symbols that represent

the dynamic changes in the piece. Composers will often use the terms piano and forte
to denote soft or loud dynamics. There are graded variations between these terms
which are listed as follows from softest to loudest: pianissimo, piano, mezzopiano,
mezzoforte, forte, and fortissimo (Presley 19). In addition to these terms, crescendos and
9

decrescendos can also be used to indicate progressive changes in the volume over time
(Figure 2.1). All of these symbols and terms help to guide a musician in performing a
piece according to the desires of the composer. These symbols primarily serve as guides
for the performing musician and their interpretations are often subjective depending on
the musician and the style of the
piece. A forte in Barber’s Adagio
for Strings may be interpreted
differently from a forte in Holst’s
The Planets: Mars, the Bringer of
War. The Adagio for Strings has
many smooth, lyrical melodic and
harmonic lines that gently build in

Figure 2.1: An example of the symbols used in music
to denote a crescendo or decrescendo

intensity and recede throughout the piece whereas Mars exhibits a thunderous march
that builds to an incredible intensity by the end of the piece. Both pieces may call for
forte at specific times, but the actual intensity of the sound will need to be relative to the
style of the piece and the other dynamics that are in the music. Holst’s piece would most
likely result in a louder more forceful forte, whereas Barber’s piece may be a more lyrical
or stylistically different forte. In addition to stylistic differences in dynamic notations,
music dynamics can also be altered by combining or omitting individual players within
an ensemble. Dynamic intensity can be progressively built by adding musicians to the
ensemble. Benjamin Britten’s Young Person’s Guide to the Orchestra adds instruments
to progressively build the dynamic intensity of the piece which is exemplified by the
staggered entrances in the figure (Figure 2.2).
	

One of the most prevalent visual elements an artist has at their disposal is the

use of space. Visual space can be used to portray size and volume in a work, and it is
often derived from a viewer’s comparison of space within a composition. On a large
10

white canvas with a black square in the center,
the area within the square can be considered
positive, and negative space can be considered
the white area around the square (Figure 2.3).
The positive space constitutes the space within
the object while the negative space encompasses
the area that is defined by the frame and the
outer edge of positive space. Artists are trained
in drawing to be cognizant of the positive and

Figure 2.2: Section taken from Britten’s
“Young Persons Guide to the Orchestra.”
Each staff represents a different
instrument and their entrances are
staggered to create a crescendo effect

Figure 2.3: A black square constituting

surrounding white space representing the

negative space in their work. The use of space and its frame defines the composition.
The goal is to create a work that is visually engaging to the viewer: A work that provides
a roadmap for the eye and allows the viewer to discover subtleties in the composition
(Fulks). This consideration in the use of space is an important aspect for my music
visualizations. I try to create a work that is visually engaging because of its dynamic
response to music and its use of positive and negative space within the composition. The
system that is responsible for controlling camera motions is one of the most important
11

aspects in my visualizations, and it is a system I continue to refine. The camera defines
the compositional frame in 3D computer animation, and its motion needs to support the
music dynamics. During quiet moments in the music, the camera needs to be close to
its subject and focused on the minute details. At louder moments, the camera can pan
outward to provide a larger perspective on the developing visual forms (Figure 2.4).

Figure 2.4: Representation of the camera altering its position which results in the cube increasing or
decreasing in size relative to the compositional frame. This is a manipulation of size based on the camera
only. The cube’s actual size in the 3D world remains the same at all times.

	

In my process, the camera represents the definition of negative space and the

adjustments in size for the visual forms that inhabit the composition are considered
positive space. My goal is to develop a camera system that automatically adjusts to
subtle dynamic variations in the music while still providing some flexibility for me to
explore new viewpoints within the visualization. The developing visual forms within the
12

frame vary in size according to the dynamics of the music (Figure 2.5). These forms may
expand to fill the composition or contract to the point where they are barely visible. These
visual forms in combination with the camera’s position and motion represent my use of
positive and negative space. My animations attempt to create an effective representation
of a live music performance that considers camera placement and the negative space
associated with that placement and the size of the subject or visual form and its effective
use of positive space.
	

The use of visual form

and space in relationship to
music dynamics is illustrated
throughout all the works produced
here. One notable example of
this relationship is from the
Drums Downtown IV work. A
suspended cymbal is struck and
a corresponding white ring of
particles grows to encompass most
of the composition (Figure 2.6).
As the ringing sound dissipates

Figure 2.5: A visual representation of a sound wave
increasing in volume and a developing visual formation
that correlates in size to the sound wave increase

into the background, the white ring continues to expand outward and dissipate until it no
longer exists. Another example, Dreams, associates ascending colored bubbles with the
striking of piano chords (Figure 2.7). The bubble’s size
is related to the velocity of the piano key being struck. The velocity information is
derived from MIDI data, and it is used to adjust the scaling of each bubble. Another
example of spatial relationships and music dynamics is used in the construction of
the real-time animation system for Drums Downtown V, Arctic Fracture (Figure 2.8).

are struck.

surface color from light to dark according to differences in the
incoming audio amplitude

This animation uses a programmable texture to control the surface color for the ground
plane. At low dynamic intensities, the ground plane is completely black or invisible to
the audience therefore creating significant negative space in the composition. As the
dynamics increase, the ground plane becomes visible with blue hues and at climatic
14

moments, the ground plane becomes completely white. All of these animation clips
exemplify some of the artistic approaches I take to associating visual space to dynamics
in music.

2.2 The function of themes, and patterns in music as they relate to visual form and
time within animation
	

My training in music has helped to elucidate structures and patterns that exist in

music, and it has helped provide a framework for my understanding of the compositional
process used in music. This understanding of music is important to me and my process
for developing visualizations because musical structures can potentially influence my
design choices and help provide a similar structure for my animations.
	

A theme in music is the principle concept that is addressed throughout the piece,

and it is typically integral to the overall form of the music. Themes can vary widely
from long lyrical lines like Beethoven’s “Ode to Joy” from his 9th Symphony to small,
short phrases. An example of a shorter theme is the famous theme in Beethoven’s 5th
Symphony, often referred to as “destiny or fate knocks at the door.” (Schenker 165)
(Figure 2.9) This theme functions as a unifying structure, both rhythmically and
melodically, throughout the entire symphony (Schenker 165). Beethoven would layer
and iterate this theme throughout for
added texture, transpose it for further
development, and restate it through
different instrumentation in his fifth

Figure 2.9: Beethoven’s 5th Symphony rhythmic
theme, “Fate knocks at the door.”

symphony. Themes function as an

overall concept for a piece of music and as Beethoven demonstrates, they can be used
in melodic, harmonic, and rhythmic capacities to unify the entire piece. Relating visual
forms to themes in music can help unify the animation just as musical themes help unify
15

a complete musical work.
	

I often create a visual form that will function in a similar manner as a musical

theme. This visual form is stated frequently throughout the animation and typically in
correspondence with the statement of the theme in the music. The visual form may iterate
and develop into other forms during contrasting sections in the music and return to the
original visual form to represent a restatement of the musical theme at the end of the
music. The visual form might be a short animation or a unique symbol or shape with the
goal of using the structural influence of a theme in music to provide a structural influence
in the animation.
	

An exploration of this visual concept is exemplified in a video installation I

constructed in Max/MSP/Jitter. This example uses the theme from Beethoven’s 5th
symphony as the basis for a short animation. Each time the theme is stated in the piece,
the program plays a short fragment that represents the theme in the music. As the
musical theme becomes layered, more and more animation fragments become visible in
the composition (Figure 2.10).
The animation is an interesting
visualization of themes within
music because it demonstrates the
immense overlaying texture of
themes, and their integral function
in the overall form of the music.
It illustrates how frequently and
how connected the “fate knocks at
the door” theme is to Beethoven’s
Fifth Symphony. My other
investigations do not illustrate

Figure 2.10: The different colored forms each represent
one fragment of Beethoven’s 5th symphony theme. The
repetition and layering of the theme between different
instruments is visually constructed in this animation.

16

a precise one-to-one mapping relationship between a specific visual form and a music
theme, but some of my works do create a visual form that functions in the same way as a
theme in music functions. The visual repetition, iteration, development, and consistency
solidify the overall concept and structure of the visual work.
	

Another good example of this visual thematic relationship is in the Drums

Downtown IV work. A hollow pentagon-shaped symbol is used throughout the piece to
denote a particular rhythmic pattern
in the music (Figure 2.11). This
pattern re-surfaces multiples times
throughout the piece because it is
the most audible pattern during two
large sections of the piece. During
these two sections, the pentagon
shape forms in time with each hit
Figure 2.11: Drums Downtown IV’s pentagon theme
which was used to denote particular drum patterns in
the music.

of the higher-pitched drum beats. In

the middle section or development
section, I allude to the pentagon by
outlining a star shape of particle trails
(Figure 2.12).
	

In the final section of the piece,

I create five different particle trail
systems that ultimately join together
at a single point. A large pentagon
shape expands outward from this

Figure 2.12: Drums Downtown IV five-pointed star
shape that functions as a subtle reference to the fivesided pentagon shape

17

central point filling the composition at the end of the performance (Figure 2.13). This
example demonstrates how an important pattern or theme throughout the music can be
transposed into a visual form that provides a unifying symbol throughout the animation.
The pentagon shape is presented in two large sections of the animation, and it is subtly
suggested in other sections of the animation. These characteristics are similar to how a
theme or motif would be presented in a music composition. The importance of a theme
in music influences my choice of shapes and forms, and I try to play off the musical
theme and use it to strengthen the visual composition. The combination of both visual
and musical themes creates a tightly integrated work that reflects the goals of creating an
animation that functions as a visual extension of music.

engulfs the entire frame.

CHAPTER 3

HISTORICAL ACCOUNT OF MUSIC VISUALIZATIONS

	

A historical account of music visualizations serves as an inspirational and

conceptual point of departure for my work. Many of these works have influenced
conceptual development and design choices exercised in my music visualizations.
Some of these influences in my work range from Fischinger’s use of abstract shapes
and motions to Wilfred’s organic and ethereal “Lumia” works. This documentation
provides a brief chronological synopsis of some important works that relate to my music
visualizations and some of the concepts I gained insight from the works.
	

The marriage of visual and music forms has challenged and inspired artists,

composers, and philosophers in our culture for centuries. Artists and musicians have
combined the two forms to create new works ranging from abstract paintings to color
organs to immersive multimedia environments. Many artists have attempted to create
synaesthetic works that unite the senses of sight and sound (Brougher). The theory of
synaesthesia breaks down sense perception into discrete units, whereby one sensation
finds its equivalent in another; music, with its notes and phrases, harmony, and
compositional structures, lends itself most readily to visual form, color, space, and motion
(Brougher). The idea of uniting visuals with music is to create a synaesthetic experience
that allows a viewer/listener to feel a transcendence or poetic response from the work
(Brougher 213). Some, like the Whitney brothers (1940’s – 1980’s), went so far as to
define themselves as a new kind of composer: One that could create ideas musically and
19

visually (Whitney 17). The advent of computers further facilitated the interdisciplinary
drive to create works that combined visual and auditory mediums. John Whitney
considered the computer as the ultimate tool for constructing a work that included visual
and auditory mediums (Whitney 17). In the digital realm of the computer, all data is
treated equally. Audio and visual data share the same framework of binary information
so both mediums can be combined, manipulated, and juxtaposed in a programming
environment.

3.1 Color Mappings to Pitches
	

The drive to create this synaesthetic experience in a work began with paintings

in the 18th century by associating specific colors with specific pitches in music. The
goal was to unite two different mediums, painting and music, in an attempt to elicit a
poetic experience for the viewer. In 1704, Sir Isaac Newton’s original concept was to
create a one-to-one mapping of the seven notes on a piano to seven colors in the rainbow
(Collopy). Other artists and inventors like Castel, Bainbridge, and Rimington each had
their own perspective on the appropriate color to sound mapping scheme (Brougher)
(Figure 3.1).
	

The figure illustrates a brief historical account of various different pitch-to-

color mapping schemes with most sharing a similar color scheme and some differing
radically (Collopy). Scriabin had a unique color mapping scheme (c. 1911) that was
based on the circle of fifths instead of a chromatic association like Newton’s concept
(McDonnell, Collopy). The circle of fifths iterates through all the available notes on
the piano, A through G#, by progressing in intervals of five rather than chromatically
by intervals of one on a piano keyboard. Though many of these mapping schemes
like Newton’s were theoretical in their application, the invention of the color organ
and the desire to “paint with sound” drove many inventors, artists, and musicians to
20

Figure 3.1: A chart of various color-to-pitch mapping schemes throughout history

construct their own ideal color-to-pitch mapping schemes. The color organ became a
physical realization of these various mappings.
	

The choice to map colors to specific pitches is also evident in my music

visualization works. The animation, Dreams, uses colors to denote changes in the chords
(Figure 3.2). The first chord is represented in green and successive chords are illustrated

Figure 3.2: Dreams animation showing the beginning chords in green

21

with blues, purples, and whites. The
demonstration I created for ACCAD’s
(Advanced Computing Center for the Arts
and Design) open house in 2007 shares
the closest relationship to Newton’s
mapping scheme. The colors for the
orbiting trail effect use a direct mapping
of the visible spectrum to the audible
range of audio frequencies. Lower
frequencies are represented in red while

Figure 3.3: Color to pitch scheme where red
equals lower frequencies while greens and blues
represent higher pitch frequencies

	

higher frequencies are colored green to
blue (Figure 3.3).

Aside from these examples, the role of specific color mapping schemes in my

work is more of an aesthetic choice that varies between the works. I do not try to conform
to one specific mapping strategy or restrict my choice of color based on musical pitch.
My color choice is related to visual themes and the choice of music. For example, in the

Figure 3.4: Arctic Fracture with varying shades and hues of blue which were used to create an artic
landscape or frozen theme

22

Arctic Fracture animation, my inspiration for the piece was frozen water droplets and
crystallizing ice formations. Variations in the color blue were used to illustrate this theme
and its frozen environment (Figure 3.4).

3.2 Color Organs
	

One of the first major inventions that merged sound and colored light was the

“light organ” (also known as a “color organ”). A light organ is essentially an organ
or clavichord that would emit a colored light based on which piano key was pressed
(McDonnell, Brougher 70). Louis Bertrand Castel created the first light organ in the
1730’s. His invention consisted of a clavichord with a screen placed above and small
windows with colored glass. Behind these windows were curtains that were attached
to keys on the keyboard. When someone pressed a key, a curtain would open up and
allow light to shine through the colored glass (McDonnell, Brougher). Bainbridge
Bishop created a similar variation around the end of the 19th century, but A. Wallace
Rimington was the first to create a color organ that used electricity in the early 1900’s.
This was the instrument that was used for Scriabin’s Prometheus, the Poem of Fire (Jon
and Moritz). Scriabin’s piece was specifically written for the color organ in 1910, and
he even had the conviction to suggest that audience members should wear white so the
colors from his piece would reflect off of them and create a unique interactive painting
(Moritz). This work is unique in that it challenged the notion that audience members were
merely observers of the performance. Scriabin’s piece invited the audience to become
participants in work. The resulting effect was an interactive light painting installation that
encompassed the entire performance space by including the musicians, light organ, and
the audience.
	

Thomas Wilfred also created a device similar to the color organ that produced

light projections for music in 1921. He called this device a Clavilux, and the art form was
23

Figure 3.5: An image from Wilfred’s Clavilux device that created his art form, “Lumia”

titled “Lumia.”(Brougher 76) Wilfred even made small Lumia boxes that could be placed
inside people’s homes. These devices looked very similar to small televisions (Lovstrom).
His Clavilux devices created some incredibly ethereal-looking projections of music
(Figure 3.5). Wilfred’s instrument created these effects according to this description
provided by the Hirshhorn Museum:
“Incandescent light passes through a moving stained-glass color wheel
and a moving reflecting cone aimed at rotating shaped-aluminum reflectors
to form constantly changing images on a translucent screen.” (Brougher
82)
	

These light projections are a driving inspiration for my works. The ability to

“paint with light” or construct ethereal, fluidic forms have captivated and pushed me
to recreate this concept using 3D computer animation. The ethereal, gas-like quality
of Wilfred’s Lumias represents this unique spatial quality in music, and its inherent
ability to immerse an auditorium in sound. Music is a very expressive medium and
this is often apparent in the physical motions and passion exemplified by a musician
24

performing live. Capturing the vigor of a violinist’s down bow stroke during a driving
musical passage, the sway of a trumpeter’s bell as they rise above the orchestra’s musical
texture, or the intricate and subtle motions of a flutist as they fly up and down along a
cascading musical line are all examples of expressive motions musicians may use during
a performance. These energetic motions inspire and drive some of the concepts in my
music visualizations. An amorphous form that can solidify or gently float throughout
the compositional space is a quality I try to develop in my work. Another quality of
these forms is their ability to linger in visual space, in the same way a musical note
decays over time. These qualities are exemplified in my work through the consistent use
of transparency and somewhat organic construction of my visual forms. The organic
bubbles in Dreams that represent piano notes, the sine-wave DNA motion of particles in
Drums Downtown IV representing the two performers, or the water-like surface quality
in Arctic Fracture that represents the bass drum all illustrate this organic visual form
that is appropriate to a visualization of music. John Whitney described the computer
as a tool that allows an artist to paint with light; a perspective that I find to be inspiring
because light shares many qualities of music. Similar qualities of light and music include
being intangible in form and capable of adding dimensionality to a space. 3D computer
animation allows me to manipulate light in a virtual world, and it is an excellent medium
for constructing ethereal and organic visual forms.

3.3 Abstract and Story-based Cinema
	

Oskar Fischinger was one of the most prominent filmmakers in creating

synaesthesia between music and visual motion. Some of his more famous works include
Motion Painting No. 1, Composition in Blue, and An Optical Poem that were produced
for MGM and distributed to theaters nationwide in 1937 (Zone). Fischinger essentially
created the first music videos almost 60 years before the creation of MTV. He constantly
25

strived to find visual harmony in his artwork through the use of color, space, and motion
(McDonnell, Brougher). In the 1940’s Fischinger worked with Disney to help create the
film Fantasia. He left due to artistic differences, but examples of his work can clearly be
seen in the first Bach section of the film (Zone).
	

Fischinger’s film work illustrates the powerful nature of music and visual

synchronization. His works demonstrate the importance of timing between music and
the visuals. This perception is vital to music visualizations because it can visually
emphasize the performance qualities of music which may include dynamics, pattern, and
form. Fischinger’s Motion Paintings are a significant contribution to the visualization
of music. White lines, arcs, and other abstract shapes dance across the compositional
frame in response to the music. These motion paintings almost resemble a carefully
orchestrated ballet of abstract shapes. Their entrances and exits from the frame are
perfectly synchronized to important beats in the music. Fischinger’s work strives to
“create a synthesis of visual art and music that could be consumed by large numbers of
people” (Brougher 91). His approach to music visualizations is a particular concern for
my work. In a similar manner, I want my music visualizations to pervade throughout the
concert-going public. The music animations in this thesis attempt to envelop the audience
in the performance space and connect them to the dynamics and thematic development of
a music performance.
	

Disney’s Fantasia was conceived by Walt Disney and it was originally called

“The Concert Feature.” Disney wanted to “develop the concept of using animation not
just as a potent story-telling device but as a kind of new art form by conceptualizing
serious music on a screen (Walt’s Masterworks). Fantasia was a significant financial
undertaking for Disney and an unconventional experiment to combine story-driven
animation with classical music. It did not become successful for Disney until its rerelease in 1969 (Brougher). Disney would continue to capitalize on re-releases of
26

Fantasia and eventually release Fantasia 2000 to continue Walt Disney’s original vision.
That concept was to make Fantasia an ongoing work that would constantly evolve
over time and introduce new animations while still retaining some of the original ones
(Fantasia 2000). Fantasia shares a similar goal with Fischinger’s works: To combine
visuals with music to create a new kind of work that can be presented to the mass public.
Fantasia demonstrated that music and animation could be linked successfully and
distributed to the general public through the film medium.
	

In Fantasia 2000, Disney animators created short animations that varied from

abstract colored butterfly swarms in the first movement of Beethoven’s 5th Symphony to
toy soldiers and ballerinas falling in love in Shostakovich’s Piano Concerto No. 2 Allegro
Opus 102. The animation sequence that accompanies Carnival of the Animals by Camille
Saint-Saëns contrasts the orchestral accompaniment with the piano soloist by juxtaposing
the instrumentations with a goofy yo-yo wielding flamingo as the pianist and an orderly,
no-nonsense flock of flamingos as the orchestra. The contrasting nature of the characters
relates to contrasting dynamics and interplay that exists between the piano soloist and the
orchestral accompaniment. These carefully orchestrated animations use the characters
to represent thematic and instrumentation differences in the piece. This technique of
associating specific visual forms or characters to a particular musical element is an
important technique I explore in my music visualizations. In my work, Arctic Fracture,
I represent each musician in the ensemble with a different ice formation. The final result
illustrates a unique dynamic interplay that exists between the musicians during the
performance. As the musicians respond to each other by varying their dynamics, different
ice formations expand and contract in size.

CHAPTER 4

COMPUTER DEVELOPMENT IN MUSIC VISUALIZATIONS

	

The advent of computer technology facilitated a new development platform for

music visualizations which enabled audio and visual information to be combined and
manipulated. Both mediums could be controlled and adjusted with one universal tool;
the computer. Max Mathews is considered the grandfather of computer sound synthesis
and his work began around 1961. Beginning in 1970, Max Mathews developed a new
synthesis system at Bell Labs called GROOVE (Generating Realtime Operations On
Voltage-controlled Equipment) (Spiegel). This computer had numerous inputs ranging
from knobs, sliders, joysticks, to even a small organ keyboard. People could create
programs using the computer’s FORTRAN IV and DAP 24 bit assembly language. By
specifying various connections, users essentially created “patches”. The system allowed
a user to control and interact with many different physical interfaces in real time. A
video component was added to the system in 1974 and thus VAMPIRE (the Video
And Music Playing Interactive Realtime Experiment) was born. Unfortunately, due to
hardware constraints at the time most of the work could not be recorded. The entire
system was operational from the late 1974 until 1979 when it was dismantled (Spiegel).
The contributions from this system include a flexible, user-patchable sound generating
system. Contemporary software such as Cycling ‘74’s Max/MSP program is based on
the contributions of this system, including the name, “Max,” and the ability to control
multiple inputs, outputs, and modify their contents as they move from one “patch” to
28

another. Max/MSP program has led to the proliferation of many real time video and
audio projects because of its unified development platform. Audio signals, MIDI data,
and video processing can all be integrated and developed in the Max/MSP program
environment. The invention of MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) provided
a common framework and specification for computers to interact with many different
mediums including music, and stage lighting systems. In addition to allowing precise
recordings of digital instruments like drum machines and electronic keyboards, MIDI can
be used to control live video feeds, synchronize recording equipment, or even drive 3D
computer animation. The Max/MSP program provides a unified graphical environment
for the combination of MIDI, music, audio, and other multimedia.

	
4.1.0 Current Approaches to Music Visualization: from theory-based to expressive/
interpretative

4.1.1 Stephen Malinowski’s Music Animation Machine
	

Stephen Malinowski’s Music Animation Machine is one example of a

contemporary approach to music-driven animation. The goal of Malinowski’s Music
Animation Machine is to illustrate a musical score that can be understood intuitively
by anyone without needing years of conventional music training and to bridge the gap
between a static page of music notation and the time-based movement of music. His
animations display a moving score without any measures, clefs or traditional music
notation (Malinowski). Malinowski’s first animation machine used hand coded values
for each measure in the music, and his later revisions incorporated MIDI as a way
to automate this process of synchronizing visuals to the music. His music animation
machine resembles a scrolling bar graph with different blocks lighting up as the
29

corresponding musical note is played (Figure 4.1). The length of the bar is associated
with the length of the note, and its position on the Y-axis corresponds to frequency of

Figure 4.1: Malinowski’s Music Animation Machine

the note. This bar scrolling visualization allows viewers to see how pitches and timing
in music relate to each other. His use of color denotes different instruments, thematic
material, or tonality (Malinowski). As the music progresses, different bars are highlighted
as their corresponding notes are played. The graph continuously scrolls to the right so that
currently playing notes are always kept in the center of the frame. This concept has also
inspired other works that expand on this visualization like Moonlight by Jared Tarbell,
Lola Brine, Corey Barton, and Wesley Venable. Their installation was exhibited at the
Texas Fine Arts Association gallery in downtown Austin, TX as part of the ‘Digital Face
of Interactive Art’ exhibition organized by the Austin Museum of Digital Art (Tarbell).
Malinowski’s work has also explored many other facets of music such as instrumentation,
tonality, timbre, interval relationships, overtone interactions, and chord relationships.
Each of these different music components have their own unique visualization that does
not necessarily adhere to his original scrolling bar graph. These visualizations vary
tremendously with some incorporating multiple colors, shapes, connecting lines, and
unique forms that represent different aspects of music (Malinowski). Malinowski even
30

created a series of works entitled Oskarettes which resembled the motion and flow of
Oskar Fischinger’s early motion studies (Malinowski).
	

Malinowski demonstrates a methodical approach to visualizing specific elements

of music that has driven the analytical approach I use to create the animation based on
the Bach Fugue analysis by David Lewin. Some of Malinowski’s animations are highly
analytical in nature and focused on specific elements in music with a targeted approach
that seeks to visually illustrate that precise element in music. Some of the concepts
visualized in his experiments are frequently discussed in music theory coursework, for
example the study of interval relationships. The goal of these analytical animations is to
inform the viewer about a complex process or structure that is inherent to music. This
process could be chord progressions and relationships between note intervals in these
chords or interval relationships between different melodic passages in the music. Artistic
expression is often reserved in these demonstrations because the animations are primarily
designed to educate the audience, and their design is targeted towards the concept that
is illustrated. The Music Animation Machine has far more applications in an educational
context or to further the development of a specific concept in music analysis. Stephen
Malinowski’s Music Animation Machine is designed to illustrate a simplified variation of
traditional music notation that is easy to understand without significant musical training.
I, on the other hand, want to capture the essence of music as an audience member who
sits and listens to a musical performance. The music analysis plays an important role in
my early decisions for an animation but the final product is not designed to educate or
illustrate some of the complex intricacies in music. I want to illustrate the expressive
dynamics of a music performance, so my music visualization demonstrations focus on the
performance-based aspects of the music and the expressive qualities that are inherent to
a performance. My goal is not to educate the audience but to build on and accentuate the
emotive and dynamic qualities of a music performance.
31

4.1.2 Wayne Lytle’s Animusic
	

Another artist that has incorporated the use of MIDI in music animations is

Wayne Lytle and his Animusic animation series. “The things that differentiate us from
most other animation studios such as Pixar is that our animation is driven by music
rather than a story, and that most of the animation here is generated procedurally rather
than through keyframing.” (Alberts) Lytle uses MIDI data to generate key frames for
3D computer animation. One of his famous animations, “More Bells and Whistles,”
was shown at SIGGRAPH in 1990 (Lytle). All his animations incorporate the use of
visually complex computer models of instruments with unique apparatus that play these
instruments. Some examples include multi-head guitar platforms with several robot
fingers that launch outwards to pluck the strings or laser light shows that fire beams of
light in time with melodic lines. One of his popular works, “Pipe Dream,” launches small
balls in perfect trajectories that hit sprawling arrays of drums and xylophone contraptions.
Lytle’s animations demonstrate the potential and capabilities of using MIDI to control an
animation. A MIDI file contains the exact timing and pitches for all the notes in a piece
of music. This information allows Lytle to create animations that perfectly anticipate the
specific note they represent. If a note event occurs at a specific time in the music, Lytle
can create an animation with a trajectory that preempts the starting time of that note.
An example of this concept is illustrated in “Pipe Dream.” Balls are launched from a
central emitter long before the note they represent is sounded. Because of this effect, the
animations exemplify a tight integration of sound and visuals with unique designs for
the construction of the virtual instruments. Another unique musical trait Lytle’s Animusic
visually demonstrates is the pitch bending of a single note. Some of his songs have brief
moments where a single note quickly bends up and down in pitch. This effect would be
similar to a trumpet player using vibrato to enhance a long note that would otherwise
seem stagnant. This modulation of the pitch is clearly demonstrated with osculating
32

beams of light.
	

An important distinction in Lytle’s work is that his animations create the

association that the visuals are causing the music. His animations clearly depict unique
instrument designs that are being played by robots, floating guitar picks, or bouncing
balls. Animusic clearly uses music as its foundation for the entire animation and this
structure is precisely what my visualization works use. His animations visually support
the music through the unique perspective of autonomous virtual instruments. His
animations are also procedurally generated in accordance to MIDI data. Both of these
concepts are represented in my music visualization demonstrations. My work visually
supports and enhances the music, and my method for creating the animations is also a
procedural technique. The Drums Downtown IV animation is an excellent example that
shares concepts with Lytle’s work. Both animations use MIDI to synchronize the visuals
to the audio and both animations are pre-rendered. One of the differentiating factors
between Lytle’s Animusic and my animations is the use of a real-time performance-based
environment. My recent works deviate from pre-rendered animations and use real-time
authoring environments like Virtools. Music analysis is performed in real-time by Max/
MSP. One of the major goals in my work is to design a music visualization that can
accommodate and adapt to the variability that exists in a live music performance.

4.1.3 E. Chew, A. Francois MuS.ART System
	

Research by Elaine Chew and Alexandre R. J. François focuses on the real-time

adaptability and musical analysis of a live performance. Their work MuSA.RT (Music on
the Spiral Array, Real-Time) depicts a spiral array as a geometric model to align musical
pitches and tonality in a live music performance (Chew). This spiral model is very similar
to the tonal model mentioned in Carol L. Krumhansl’s research overview entitled “The
Geometry of Musical Structure: A Brief Introduction and History.” (Krumhansl) This
33

model chromatically aligns pitches in ascending frequency along a spiral, which functions
as a representation of pitch classes. The model in the MuS.ART system demonstrates the
relativity of pitches and the relationships between tonal centers that develop throughout
a piece of music (Chew). Chew and François’ music visualization system tracks the
progression of chords, pitches, and tonality throughout a piece of music and translates
this progression into spatial points or centers of effect (CEs) in their visualization model
(Chew). The system is an excellent visualization of a real-time music analysis that tracks
the perceived change in a tonal center of a piece. This work and Carol Krumhansl’s
research were invaluable tools for the visualizations I created with Jacob Reed. Their
research provided a framework for our animations that depict interval relationships in
the first six measures of Bach’s Fugue #14 in F minor. The MuSA.RT system and our
theory animations serve the distinct purpose of illustrating or educating an audience
about a specific function or relationship in music. The MuSA.RT system uses a real-time
environment and 3D animation to track tonality in Classical music. The animations of
Bach’s Fugue visually convey interval patterns that exist in the introductory measures of
the music. Both animations focus on a particular music theory principle and visualize this
concept to aid in understanding. Another commonality between this animation and my
later music animations is the use of a real-time environment. A critical goal of the MuSA.
RT system is to track tonality in a real-time performance setting. My animations also seek
to visualize music in a real-time environment, but my animations focus on the expressive
qualities of the performance instead of on the analytical approach taken by Chew and
François’ visualization system.

4.1.4 Cirque du Soleil: DELIRIUM
	

A live concert I had the pleasure of seeing twice has influenced a significant

portion of my work as a visual artist for music performances. Cirque du Soleil is typically
known for their incredible multimedia driven performances that focus on human
acrobatics, flexibility stunts, and complex choreography. Their live concert, DELIRIUM,
took a different approach. “For the first time Cirque du Soleil puts musicians and singers
center-stage with their music as the driving force of this gigantic event.” (Delirium) The
show highlights the musicians and their music with minimal acrobatics. The show was
created by Michel Lemieux and Victor Pilon, and they collaborated together to create a
show that is based around the music of previous Cirque du Soleil shows. The theme of
the show was “driven by an urban tribal beat” that incorporates awe-inspiring visuals,
musicians, singers and dancers (Delirium). The touring show takes place on a stage in
the shape of a Roman numeral one or “I” with the audience facing the long central beam
of the “I” figure. Projections cover the entire length of the stage so animations cover
about 270 square feet of projection space or the equivalent of almost 2 IMAX screens
(Delirium). The resulting performance is an amazing, immersive, multimedia experience.
The visuals are carefully synchronized critical events in the live music performance. I
was disappointed when I discovered that some of the most impressive visuals appeared to
be pre-rendered sequences. It would have been more interesting if the visuals responded
in real-time to the performance. Since live musical performances are never exactly
the same from one performance to the next, it would have been interesting to see a
visualization that was capable of illustrating those variations. Despite this observation,
it did not detract from the overall experience, and I was still awestruck at the visuals
that were integrated into the show. There was one particular moment in the show that
really stood out in visualizing the music. A singer was introduced on stage by projecting
massive sound waves that spread across the entire screen as she began to sing. This
35

was one of the most direct correlations I saw between the music and the visuals. Her
projected sound waves dissipated a large bubble in the middle of the screen on stage
which eventually broke down into a single line that stretched the entire width of the
stage. As the drum beat in the song started, spikes that resembled an EKG monitor pulse
began racing across the stage (Figure 4.2). The imagery looked pre-rendered to but its
synchronization and execution with the music was flawless. To see a music performance

Figure 4.2: Cirque du Soleil DELIRIUM concert with the EKG pulsing line across the stage

visualized on such a large scale was a breath-taking experience for me. The large
scale visualization was definitely a contributing factor to the immersive effect and my
experience of the concert.
	

The Drums Downtown IV and V performances best represent the influence

this show has on my development process. Both of these performances incorporate
a projected image behind the musicians. The Drums Downtown IV event uses a prerendered animation that the performers have to conform to in order for their music to
synchronize with the visuals. The Drums Downtown V performance uses a real-time
36

animation system that responds to the musicians. Both of these performances attempt to
visually capture this dynamism that exists in music by visually engaging the audience.
This level of excitement is something I try to incorporate in my work by visually
capturing the grandeur, passion, and dynamics of a live music performance. When a
music ensemble builds in intensity to a climactic moment in the music, I attempt to
visually emphasize this moment in my real-time animations. DELIRIUM is an excellent
example of this effect, and I think it merely scratches the surface of what is possible with
live music visualizations.
	

Cirque du Soleil’s DELIRIUM concert also opened my eyes to the possibilities

of a greater influence the computer could have on my work and how the computer could
be better integrated into a live music performance. This was a conceptual junction in my
work where I realized the computer’s real time analysis and rendering capabilities could
be used to enhance and respond to a performance. This started my development process
towards using the computer as a visual instrument and the appropriate relationship that
would exist between the artist and the computer.

CHAPTER 5

THE ROLE OF THE COMPUTER TO THE ARTIST

	

The use of the computer in my process of creating real-time music visualizations

involves a complex balancing act of control between my artistic concepts and
the computer’s ability to manipulate vast amounts of data at a speed measured in
milliseconds. The music visualization system allows the artist to function as a mediator
between the incoming music data streams and the computer’s pre-programmed
capabilities. The system provides unique control sets for the artist to manipulate
the visualization in ways that are not necessarily possible by audio analysis alone.
Development of the system is divided into three different phases; initial creation of
assets, programming the automated functions in the system and designing artist controls,
and the final execution of the system during a live music performance. Due to the
generative nature of the second phase and its potential outcomes for the third phase of
development, these two design phases may iterate between each other multiple times
before a satisfactory visual form is created.
	

In the preliminary design and construction phase of the animation system,

the computer functions as a content creation tool. The initial design, concept, and
construction of the music visualizations use the computer to digitally create visual forms
and animate these forms for the animation. This asset creation process is similar to the
methods used to create a computer generated film. Artists use 3D animation programs
like Autodesk’s Maya to model an object. The modeled object is then surfaced or
38

textured. Images are mapped onto its surface giving it a more detailed appearance. The
textured object is then animated and placed into a scene. The creation of assets is heavily
dependent on the artist for decision-making. The computer primarily functions as a
complex tool providing no creative input of its own in the process. After the construction
of all assets for the animation, I begin to design a system that will incorporate these assets
into a real-time virtual environment that responds to audio input.
	

The computer has the capacity to manipulate and analyze large amounts of data

in milliseconds. These data streams can drive various functions within an animation,
for example the scaling, translation, or rotation of an object. One of the key design
challenges is to decide which animation functions would be best suited for this type of
manipulation and which functions should be controlled by the artist. An audio spectrum
analysis moves too quickly for an artist to meaningfully react to what has been processed,
and the computer is far more capable of managing this data and visually reacting to it in a
real-time system. This is where I choose to relinquish some control over the development
of the animation and allow the computer to interact with the music data. The decision to
balance control between the computer and the artist arises frequently during this phase
of development. As an artist and a programmer, it can be tempting to push the system to
one extreme or another. For example, the animation system could be completely driven
by the computer with minimal input from the artist except during the conceptual and
asset creation phase. An example of this system would be the music visualization effect
in Apple iTunes. An artist or programmer designed all the parameters for the system and
a user is typically limited to changing between a select number of visualization presets.
At the other extreme is a pre-rendered animation similar to Disney’s Fantasia 2000.
The artists are responsible for all aspects of this animation. They have complete control
over the entire process associated with animation including the story’s development and
outcome. The artists create the concept for the story, illustrate all the characters, animate
39

them in synchronization with the music, control lighting, camera viewpoints, and control
the finishing touches for the animation. The computer merely serves as a content creation
tool with no creative input in any facet of the process.
	

To balance the control between computer and artist, I designed my music

visualization system with multiple hierarchical levels of control. Lower levels in
the system are completely automated with the computer driving rotation, scaling, or
translation values of an object based on a live audio data stream. Higher levels in the
system might incorporate other audio data streams to control the same object’s color, or
the camera’s distance from the object. An example of this system might use the amplitude
from an audio data stream to adjust the scaling or size of a cube. A level above this one
might use the pitch information from the same data stream to alter the rotational values
of the cube. A third level above this might use a different audio data stream to control
the translation values of the cube on the X and Z-axis. The final level above all of these
may use a keyboard input, or some other input dependent on the artist, to direct the
camera’s viewpoint or the cube’s translation value on the Y-axis. Creating structured
levels of control allows the artist to react to each control in the music visualization and
respond accordingly. Driving translation values for the cube may prove to be too erratic
in movement during the first iteration of this specific system due to subtle fluctuations in
the data that dictates those translation values. A second level of control could smooth this
erratic behavior. Building a hierarchy of control levels provides the artist an opportunity
to correct, change, or build on the visual results of these different levels. My strengths
as an artist and musician are the ability to see or hear patterns and themes in the music
that span greater periods of time. Using my knowledge of forms in music, I can envision
and predict overarching structures in the music. The influence of musical forms allows
me to distinguish transition periods and higher level structures or concepts in the music.
This unique ability to conceptualize and calculate trajectories in musical forms is a key
40

distinguishing factor between the artist’s decision-making process and the computer’s
capacity for high-speed data analysis. As the artist, I can react to the music in a more
meaningful way than can the computer because of my artistic sensibilities and my
knowledge of music which includes the ability to distinguish structures, patterns, and
themes in music.
	

The artist is ultimately responsible for the visuals in the animation and the

programming that defines the computer’s boundaries; however, there are periods when
the computer provides inspiration based on its unanticipated output of the data. For
example, the cube might use audio amplitude values to drive its translation values on
the X and Z-axis. The system might prove to be too erratic in motion at first, so the artist
adjusts the values to smooth out the translational movement. The resulting movement
might create swooping motions, elegant arcs, and dynamic curves which may not have
been previously considered by the artist. After being captivated by the new motion, the
artist might create another system above this one that traces the outline of these curves
and this motion may become the foundation for future developments in the animation
system. This is a unique trait in which the interplay between the computer and the artist
becomes more of a shared experience as each entity responds to another in the continuing
development of the animation system. The artist is ultimately in control, but the final
animation may be taken in an entirely different direction than originally intended.
	

The third phase of development continues this interplay between the artist and the

computer into the execution of the animation during a live music performance. The artist
uses pre-programmed controls to manipulate the animation in order to accommodate
his or her interpretation of larger structural themes that may be present in the music.
The computer generates visual forms that quickly react to multiple incoming audio
data streams. Both the computer and the artist capitalize on their strengths and react to
each other in tandem to create a unique visualization of a live music performance. The
41

computer is responsible for the more intricate and repetitive motions in the animation
yet within the framework of the audio analysis, there is room to generate the unknown
and unexpected. The artist in turn responds to these unknowns and intricate nuances that
are generated by the computer. The artist can also adjust the entire visualization by using
the higher level of controls in the hierarchy to the different musical patterns and themes
as they develop. The potential interplay between these two entities during a live music
performance is immense.
	

During the live performance, the computer and the artist react to the musicians

through this shared hierarchy of control levels. The computer micro-manages all
incoming audio data streams and manipulates the size of visual forms in the animation,
adjusts camera motions, and controls other parameters like color saturation. The artist
shares the same control system with the computer, but the various levels of control allow
the artist to override some decisions made by the computer and influence developments
on a larger scale in the animation. The artist and the computer essentially function as a
visual musician in the performance. The relationship between the computer and the artist
represents many similar qualities that a musician exemplifies in the performing ensemble.
Musicians are bound to each other through the framework of the written notation. All
are responsible for their own parts, and they are responsible for interpreting those parts
in connection with their fellow musicians. The computer/artist relationship is also
bound to the musicians by responding to the sounds they play. The computer and artist
are responsible for accurately visualizing performance qualities such as dynamics and
thematic structures. The unpredictable potential in a performance for musicians and the
computer/artist performer is in their interpretations of the music and their connection to
each other. Musicians in an ensemble must faithfully interpret the music and blend with
their partners so that the ensemble functions as one in its interpretation of the music. The
artist and computer also need to function as one entity that can effectively visualize the
42

performance and become a performing member of the ensemble. Allowing the computer
to react to the music through programmed means to create visuals in the animation that
are different than the expectations of the artist adds a humanistic and instrumental quality
to its presence in the ensemble. Musicians performances will always vary slightly in
tempo, dynamics, technique in their instruments, and in their interpretation of the music.
The computer’s construction of visuals that differ from the artist’s original concepts for
the animation mimics this interpretive variation of a musician in the performance and
creates a variable element for the artist to master.
	

In effect, the computer can be considered a visual instrument for the artist.

The programming required to create visuals is similar to musicians practicing their
instruments in preparation for the concert. The programmed environment for the
computer exemplifies subtle nuances that the artist must learn to control just as the
trumpet’s sounding of the low D (D4) note has a strong tendency to be sharp in pitch
and must be adjusted. Some subtleties that exist in a programming environment include
how data is stored and retrieved, the appropriate syntax for writing a function, or a
specific network protocol that can interface with multiple different software programs.
All of these elements have their own unique behaviors and getting them to communicate
with each other shares a similar relationship to how a musician would practice his or
her instrument. Musicians learn to adapt to these nuances in their efforts to master the
ability to play the instrument. As a visual artist and programmer, I need to adapt to slight
variations in programs, protocols, and scripting languages in order for them to all work
in harmony and generate functioning music visualizations. The resulting animations
signify a mastery and practice session with the computer as a visual instrument of light
which is a similar concept to one John Whitney refers to in his book, Digital Harmony:
On the Complimentarity of Music and Visual Art. The computer can be used as a visual
instrument by the artist and connect with the musicians in the performing ensemble to
43

generate a real-time visualization of the live music performance.
	

The implications for this type of authoring system are valuable to not only this

field of study, but in other disciplines as well. Creating a hierarchy of control systems
can present visualization systems that are truly adaptable to their content. This type of
system could aid in adaptive learning environments where the combination of a computer
and human could interact with a child to enhance the child’s learning experience. It
could also be used to construct advanced artificial intelligence systems. The computer’s
fast response times and the human’s deep analytical perceptions can be combined to
create a powerful A.I. system that benefits from the human’s and computer’s strengths.
The system is still dependent on the influence of a human but the human’s abilities to
manipulate data would be enhanced by the computer’s faster response times. The entire
system demonstrates the possibilities of a computer functioning as a highly customized
tool for a specific user and for a specific application. This work documents the computer’s
customized function in real-time music visualization capacity.
	

The computer’s role in the development of this music visualization system starts

in a traditional role and continues to evolve to become a partner or companion during
the final performance. The initial phase of development uses the computer as a tool
for content creation and exploration. The second phase is where the computer’s ability
to construct visual forms that may be unexpected for the artist provides an avenue for
artistic inspiration and potential design direction in the creation of a hierarchical control
system. This is when the artist may discover unique visual forms and design or program
additional sets of control to manipulate these new forms. Creating a hierarchy of control
allows the artist to evaluate the computer’s interpretations by limiting the complexity
and variables that are added to the overall system. The third phase is where both entities
work together to react to the live music performance. The computer analyzes multiple
audio data streams and uses the data to generate visual forms and motions on a micro44

level. The artist has access to the various different levels of control spanning from some
micro-level controls to macro-level controls. The artist can respond to small nuances in
the computer’s generative forms or make sweeping changes to the overall visual structure
of the animation. These changes could be in response to larger musical evolutions like
thematic developments and pattern recapitulations. This system is unique because it
requires both entities to work in tandem to create the animation. The computer can
micromanage multiple data streams and drive the animations while the artist can respond
to these animations and adjust them according to the music performance.
	

Designing a system that allows the computer to produce visuals that differ from

the artist’s original vision forces the artist to interpret and react to these dynamic elements
and creates a compelling animation process that responds to a music performance. The
construction of these dynamic elements distinguishes the computer as a visual instrument
that the artist uses to create music visualizations. The computer’s relationship to the
artist is similar to the relationship between a musician and his or her instrument. Music
performances can never be perfectly replicated and will vary slightly in their tempos,
dynamics, and interplay between the musicians. These factors often contribute to what
makes live music events so exciting. Variations in the musicians’ interpretations of the
music, unexpected visual formations that are constructed by the computer’s analysis of
the performance, and the artist’s reaction to all these live generative elements represents
the exciting dynamic interconnected system that exists between all performers in a live
music visualization performance.

CHAPTER 6

DESIGNING MUSIC VISUALIZATIONS

6.1 A Tetrahelix Animates Bach: Visualization focusing on Music Theory
	

A Tetrahelix Animates Bach is an exploration in the use of 3D computer

animation as a medium for visualizing complex theoretical structures in music. I
collaborated with a music theory student, Jacob Reed, in the design and implementation
of a series of 3D animations for Neo-Riemannian Theory. Our work was based on the
analysis made by David Lewin on the first six measures of Bach’s Fugue 14 in F# Minor.
David Lewin brought innovations to music theory in the form of mathematically-based
theory and the development of transformational theory. These subjects are discussed in
his treatise Generalized Musical Intervals and Transformations. The transformational
theory concept is succinctly summarized by Lewin’s question in his treatise, “If I am at s
and wish to get to t, what characteristic gesture should I perform in order to arrive there?”
(Lewin 159) His work focuses on relationships between structures and patterns in music
and how these relationships might build to illustrate larger patterns.
	

Our research first consisted of finding an appropriate geometric form that

succinctly represents all twelve pitches in addition to showing a chromatic and octave
association between the pitches. Carol Krumhansl, a researcher affiliated with Cornell
University in Ithaca, New York, has discussed many issues related to our problem
including geometric forms that represent music, psychological perceptions, tonal
relationships in music, and a concise history of previous visual mappings of pitch classes
46

(Krumhansl). One visual form we discovered to be ideal for our representations was a
three-spine spiral helix. We arrived at this structure on our own accord before validating
it with Krumhansl’s research. This helix shares a similarity to Shepard’s geometrical
approximation that is outlined in Krumhansl’s historical synopsis (Krumhansl). This
geometric form is also incorporated into other music analysis research like Chew’s and
François’ MuSA.RT real time visualization system (Chew).
	

Our spiral form associates distance with pitch relationships which determines

the space between points along the spiral (Figure 6.1). The higher one progresses up the
spiral, the higher the pitch. Horizontal lines that are projected through the spiral connect

Figure 6.1: The first spiral shows the relationship between the same pitch in two different octaves. The
second spiral shows how all the different pitches climbed in a uniform layout along the spiral. The third
spiral represents our final shape used in the animations.

to points along the spiral to form vertices for the tetrahedrons. Since we were using
computer-generated shapes, we used each point’s position in space to define polygons
on the spiral. The polygons form the tetrahedron shapes, and stacking the tetrahedrons
47

on top of each other represents the basic pitch interval pattern that was explored in
Lewin’s analysis of the Bach fugue. We used different colors to highlight respective faces
on the tetrahedrons, and these colors represented the subject, answer, countersubject,
and crosstalk within the first few measures of the fugue. The resulting 3D animations
provided an excellent visualization for Lewin’s analysis of Bach’s fugue. The animations
also augment the analysis by demonstrating in real time how Bach “surfs,” as Lewin
describes, through “Cohn flips,” or a graph constructed of relational sets of different note
intervals (Reed). These visualizations are analytical in nature, but they demonstrate how
3D computer animation can be used to visualize various forms and structures within
music theory. By illustrating patterns and structures on various theoretical levels from
note interval relationships to subjects, answers, and countersubjects, computer generated
animations can elucidate hierarchical patterns and structures that exist in other musical
works.
	

The analytical function and purpose of this type of music visualization was

appealing to me because of its interdisciplinary focus and its potential educational
benefits. Creating work with music theorists that visually demonstrates complex problems
in their field of study was an exciting avenue of visual exploration. 3D computer
animation could elucidate and amplify musical analyses to help educate music theorists
and students about the complexities that are inherent to many musical compositions.
Unfortunately, the field of music theory felt dry and the artistic interpretive side of me
was yearning for more. I did not want to create animations that served only to deconstruct
music theory into graphical patterns for closer study. I wanted to explore an alternative
interpretation of music that focuses on the emotive, expressive, and dynamic qualities of
a live performance. I wanted to create an animation that grows, recedes, and responds to
a music performance. This visualization of Bach’s Fugue was an important step in my
development because it helped to clarify the concept for my work, which is to visually
48

accentuate the expressive and dynamic qualities of a live performance through animation.
These animations also stressed the importance of automation and scripting in my work.
The creation of the geometric form and the synchronization of the animation to Bach’s
Fugue 14 in F# minor was a very time consuming process. The tetrahedron vertices were
meticulously animated to the striking sound of a piano key. Thankfully the project only
required the animation of the first six measures in the fugue. This process is not suitable
for larger scale works or complex animations that require key framing movements for
multiple entities. In order to animate and synchronize complete musical works to a
computer generated animation, I need to develop a system that is capable of extracting
audio data and using it to generate key frames or motions within the animation.

6.2 Dreams: Creation of a system for generating synchronous animations to music
	

In order to create a system that can automate the synchronization between audio

and visuals, I explored the use of Maya Embedded Language (MEL) scripting and
Music Interface Digital Instrument (MIDI) data. MEL scripting provides the capability
to automate any task necessary in Maya while MIDI data provides precise timings for
musical notes, note duration, and the pitch or audio frequency of each note.
The first step in my process was to extract the MIDI data into an acceptable form for
Maya and MEL scripts. A program that converts MIDI files into an ASCII text format was
created by Piet van Oostrum from the Utrecht University in the Netherlands (Oostrum).
This tool extracts all MIDI data into a sequential list that includes a timestamp of the note
that was hit, the channel the note was played on, the pitch of the note, and the velocity at
which it was struck. With this provided, I then developed my own MEL script that opens
the appropriate MIDI file and initiates the conversion to a text format. After creating the
text file, the script extracts the relevant data and discards unnecessary information such
as the midi-specific channel for the note and stores the data in memory as arrays. The
49

second phase of the MEL script iterates through the arrays and applies key frames for
translations, scaling, or any other desired motion on a respective 3D object. Since each
note event has a corresponding timestamp, I was able to synchronize the key frames to
these timestamps in the animation timeline. One problem I overcame was the translation
of MIDI “ticks” into animation frames. Determining the frequency of ticks in relation
to seconds allows me to convert the seconds into the 24 frames that correspond to one
second of animation. This alignment between visual frames and MIDI ticks is a critical
component to creating a clear synchronization between the visuals and the music. This
synchronization satisfies the goal of creating key frame information in response to a
musical piece. With the process of generating key frames automatically with the MEL
script, I explored relationships between the adjusted MIDI data and visual forms in
motion.
	

My initial explorations focused primarily on simple abstract forms such as a

sphere or a trail of particles. I discovered how easy it was to synchronize motions to
musical events, and it was very easy to get lost in the programming aspects of the project.
During this exploratory phase I often struggled with appropriate mapping strategies or
visual relationships between form, color, space, and the large amounts of data. Particle
systems were of particular interest to me because particles naturally leave behind a trail.
Particle life span, color, and position can be manipulated by MIDI data which consists
of pitch, note length, and velocity information. Depending on the life span, particles can
illustrate the development of a line or similar visual form over a period of time. Their
size can be adjusted to convey dynamic swells in the music. I wanted to visually convey
a history of developments in the music, so this aspect is particularly important in my
early works. Music is constantly evolving in time and by illustrating a short history of
development through the use of particle systems, I am able to provide a brief snapshot of
the music’s development.
50

	

One example of this effect can be seen in the short animation entitled Dreams.

The animation incorporates most of the MEL scripting techniques I developed thus far.
Colored bubbles burst upwards depending on when a piano note is struck. The physical
qualities of a bubble’s shape best represent the sound quality of a piano note. A piano note
does not have a forceful impact at the beginning of its sound and it gently dissipates into
silence. The round shape of a bubble depicts this gentle rise and fall of the note through
the perfect curves on its surface. The slight imperfections that might exist in a bubble
represent the slight tonal variations that exist in a piano note’s sound.
	

The size of the bubble is determined by the velocity of the note hit, so louder

notes are larger than softer notes. Multiple bubbles rise up at once when a chord is
played. Chords in music consist of two of more notes that are played simultaneously;
however, an analysis of the note timings indicates that notes are typically a few
milliseconds apart from each other. In order to account for this subtle discrepancy in
timing, I created a system that groups notes into one chord if they were played within a
certain period of time. (This system essentially accounts for the fact that humans are not
able to play three or four notes in a chord on the piano at the exact same time. A threshold
or period of time is used to create a window for all notes to be collected and considered
as one chord.) The colors of the bubbles change according to the quality of the chord
such as major, to minor, to diminished seventh. These color transitions are directly
written into the MEL script. .
	

Multiple rings or dust clouds that expand in size and move in an outward direction

from a central point constitute a shockwave pattern that I used every time a chord is
played. The shockwaves incorporate a color scheme that is shared with the bubbles,
and they are used to denote the average interval distance between all the notes in that
chord. For example, two chords played at opposite ends of the keyboard yield a very
large and expansive shockwave because of the large interval distance between all the
51

notes while two chords that are played close together on the keyboard have smaller
intervals between the notes so these would yield a smaller and shorter-lived shockwave.
The bubbles represent an ideal choice for the stylistic and auditory feel of a piano note,
but the composition lacked depth so I chose to create a shockwave or expanding ring of
particles. This is one of my first explorations into using space within the composition to
illustrate music. The shockwave provides additional dimensionality to the work, but I do
not feel the shockwaves clearly depict a relationship between chords with small interval
differences and chords with large interval differences. The shockwaves remain within
the frame too long for a viewer to see an appreciable difference in the interval distance
between chords, but they do help to visually accentuate the point in time when a chord is
struck, and they provide a sense of depth to the composition.
	

This example was a good demonstration of the MEL scripting capabilities I had

developed, but it also exemplified some difficulties I had in mapping various musical
events to an appropriate visual effect. During the initial design phases of this project I
was overwhelmed by the avenues of exploration. Creating relationships between visuals
and music could incorporate hundreds of different elements. I attempted to narrow my
possibilities by creating a list of elements in the visual and music realms in order to make
the task more manageable. The table outlines some of the major elements in visuals and

music that could be correlated through artistic interpretations (Figure 6.2).
	

This list was helpful in sorting out some possibilities that I could explore. Some

of the more interesting possibilities for me were the association of color to pitch, volume/
dynamics to object scaling or size, and articulation to shape. Just as Sir Isaac Newton
and Scriabin had developed their own color to pitch interpretations, I felt color and pitch
relationships could play a vital role in my animations by illustrating different audio
frequencies. Volume and size associations could adhere to our instinctual perceptions and
expectations of louder sounds being larger and softer sounds being smaller. Articulations
as they relate to shapes could help distinguish different sounds or timbres. A loud clap
has an entirely different shape in comparison to a plucked string. Both sounds have
different characteristics: the clap has a sharp, striking sound that pierces the air while the
plucked string has a slight thud in the beginning of its sound as the finger swipes across
the string’s surface, and the quality of the sound that reverberates afterwards is much
softer and longer lasting when compared to the quick dissipation of a clapping sound.
As I considered and described these different characteristics of sound, I became more
interested in visualizing these sounds and less interested in analyzing structures in music.
I enjoyed creating the animation, Dreams, and I was anxious to visually explore other
sounds and how those sounds could be depicted.
	

MEL scripts were also becoming too cumbersome in managing and organizing

data. It was difficult to integrate complex pattern matching, chord detecting, and pitch
analysis into a MEL script. MEL scripts do not allow arrays within arrays or dynamically
resized matrices. For example, the size of a matrix in Maya must be specified at the
beginning of its creation and it cannot be altered afterwards (Matrices). This is just one
example of the hurdles I began to encounter as I attempted to incorporate a theoretical
analysis of music into my MEL scripts. Furthermore, there are other programs which are
more adept to analyzing MIDI data and providing a musical analysis, so I did not want to
53

“reinvent the wheel” by using MEL scripting to perform MIDI analyses.
My work also began to deviate from the artistic and visual interpretations of music. I was
constantly bogged down by the programming aspects of the work, which diverted my
focus from the artistic and visual interpretations of the music. My previous animation
work with Jacob Reed was heavily focused on the theoretical patterns and analysis of
music, while the Dreams animation represented a departure from this type of work. I
explored other aspects of music while still retaining some music theory elements like
interval differences and chord classes. My focus for music visualizations was moving
towards an artistic and interpretive approach that does not require a conventional music
theory analysis of the piece. The intended audience for my animations was expanding
beyond music theorists to include the general concert-going public. The goal of my work
was to create a visualization that an audience could appreciate as an artistic and visual
experience that enhances a live performance, and for the work to reflect the dynamic and
inspiring moments of that performance. To satisfy these refined goals, I began to explore
the more general use of motion, dynamics, and visual space and how these elements
might accentuate and respond to a live music performance. I narrowed the focus of my
study on performance qualities and abandoned complex theoretical analyses of music.
These experimentations in MEL scripting did provide me with a strong framework for
my next project which uses MEL scripting for timing and synchronization within an
animation.

6.3 Drums Downtown IV: Live performance to pre-rendered visualization
	

Drums Downtown IV was a unique opportunity to design a 3D computer

generated animation for a live musical performance, entitled carpe diem by the Pendulum
Duo. This percussion piece “was written in 1996 to further expand on the repertoire for
two percussionists in a soloistic setting.” (Drums Downtown IV) The animation is created

using MEL scripts which dynamically build and synchronize visual forms to create a
procedurally generated animation. The musicians are paramount to the performance so
they are placed down stage towards the audience. The animation is presented on a large
screen behind the musicians to visually reinforce their performance.
	

The pre-recorded audio performance of carpe diem was provided in advance for

synchronization purposes, and so I could study and formulate a visual interpretation of
the piece. I formulated my interpretation of the music by sketching blueprints (Figure
6.3). These sketches represent a rough concept of some contrasting themes, rhythmic

Figure 6.3: This represents one of my sketches for music where different lines and shapes represent
different musical elements like contrasting themes or sounds, and rhythmic changes in the music

differences, and similar sounding patterns in the music. The shapes of the lines often
denote the progression of the music passage, whether it is moving upwards or downwards
in pitch, or perhaps a rhythmic passage builds or recedes in dynamic intensity. These
figures may indicate different types of attacks like sudden percussive attacks, or slowly
growing string bowings. These sketches in combination with the music influence my
artistic choices for visual forms in the animation. The strong percussive attacks are
visually represented by angular shapes like squares and triangles whereas soft, mellow,
55

and resonant sounds were represented by spheres, ellipses, or other curved forms. (My
visual choices for form are always influenced by the sounds in the music.) I chose
to divide the animation into five contrasting thematic styles or patterns based on my
interpretation of carpe diem. Dividing the piece into five distinct sections also helped to
modularize the MEL scripting development.
	

Artistic interpretations are often made in a fashion similar to how musicians must

interpret music. Musicians usually do not have the luxury of contacting the composer to
discuss their thought process and their personal interpretation of the music they wrote.
Instead, the interpretation is reliant on the musician’s background knowledge of music.
However, if one is fortunate enough to meet with the composer, valuable insight can be
gained on specific sections of the music. My process mirrors the interpretive challenges
a musician often faces when performing a piece of music. Most of my decisions are
based on my independent artistic and musical interpretation of the work while some
segments are directly informed by a specific concept the composer was trying to convey
in their music. I was fortunate enough to have access to the program notes written by the
composer herself for carpe diem, so I was able to use them to influence my interpretive
process. For example, the first section involves an Aaron Copland inspired fanfare
(Drums Downtown IV). Aaron Copland’s music often expresses majesty through his
use of lengthening notes, creating spaces of silence in his music, and tenderly stretching
folk song themes (Berger, Copland 61). His work has been visually associated with the
vastness of American landscapes so I chose to work with this common interpretation by
creating a vast open space in the beginning of the piece (Berger 92, Copland).
	

The opening section of carpe diem shares similar qualities to Copland’s music

by creating long periods of silence that are interspersed with strong gong hits, rolling
cymbal crashes, and triumphant timpani hits. All of these musical sounds in the beginning
section were associated with a different visual element based on the qualities of their
56

sound. (Figure 6.4) Hazy clouds cover the lower field of view in the animation to create
a dramatic sense of depth in the composition. The cloud texture is animated to convey
some movement and illustrate the extent of the depth in this opening shot. A large
glowing ring emanates from the center of the swirling clouds to ground the audience’s

sound of the gong hit and the yellow circle represents the strike from a timpani.

view and reinforce the distant horizon line. This glowing ring expands and brightens
with the dynamic building of the suspended cymbal roll which climaxes with a loud hit
from the gong. The expanding and contracting ring is used to emphasize the contrasting
dynamics and crescendo during the opening sequence. Colored bursts from beneath
the cloud texture resemble the pointed attack of the timpani hits which occur after the
climactic build of the suspended cymbal and gong. These colored bursts quickly expand
and contract because the timpani do not reverberate as long as the gong hit. The ring
and colored bursts resemble the type of sound each percussion instrument creates, and
their motions reflect the changing dynamics of the performance. The overall composition
depicts an expansive space that shares inspirational characteristics of Copland’s
57

compositions with sparse visual interjections that adjust in size to represent the changing
dynamics in the opening of the performance.
	

The second section of the animation begins the interplay between the two

percussionists with one performer playing a consistent pattern which functions as a
bass line while the other percussionist begins a pattern on the higher-pitched tom-toms.
To illustrate this interplay between the performers, I incorporated a double helix that
continually ascends in the frame. The interweaving nature of the double helix represents
the communication the two performers exhibit as both of their musical lines connect
with perfect rhythmic integrity. A hollow pentagon shape represents the high-pitched
tom-tom pattern which audibly stands out above the baseline due to its higher pitch. At
one point during this section, the regimented rhythms take a momentary break where the
percussionists play an interjection that is completely different. I attempted to accentuate
this moment and show the audience that it was a unique break in the consistent rhythms
that had been exemplified so far in the second section. I used different camera viewpoints
to accentuate contrasting rhythmic passages the music by angling the camera’s viewpoint
downward so the audience could see the overall pattern that had been created (Figure
6.5). After the interjection, the rhythm resumes and thus the camera returns to its original
side-facing view of the animation.
	

Typically in a large symphony’s piece in sonata form, there is a development

section where iterations or variations on a theme may be explored or contrasted with
previous thematic ideas (Berry 190). In the third section of carpe diem, the piece takes a
noticeable turn from strong repeatable rhythmic patterns to a more developmental phase
where different rhythmic motifs are explored. I labeled this section the exploratory or
development section. There are three important visual elements in the third section that
relate to different musical passages or instruments. The third section includes cymbal
attacks, a “rolling drum” sequence, and snare drums flams, or accents. The first visual
58

Figure 6.5: This image shows the altered camera view. The differing camera angle
corresponds with a brief pause or change in the rhythmic patterns

element is a shockwave-like white ring which represents the cymbal strikes. This ring
shape is closely related to the actual shape of a cymbal, and its high white intensity
provides a representation of the higher frequencies that are exhibited by a cymbal hit. The
high frequencies of the cymbal hit present a very bright and loud dynamic contrast in the
music. Associating this instrument with large, white rings that expand outward illustrates
the bright timbre or sound of the cymbal. The second visual element that is introduced is
the “rolling drum” sequence. This pattern occurs during the beginning of the third section
where the glowing line loops around itself in a diagonally-downward moving motion
(Figure 6.6). This moment corresponds with a repetitious pattern of drums descending
in pitch and their repetitious pattern. The descent in pitch relates to the downward
movement; the loops help to iterate the repetitious nature of the pattern. The third element
59

uses snare drum accents
to propel a particlebased line throughout
the composition. Each
snare drum hit causes the

leap forward creating this
visual sense of the line
being pushed across the

composition. Most of the visual forms created by the particle line are abstract. However,
one formation outlined by the particles resembles a five-pointed star which is a subtle
reference to the five-sided pentagon shape that was introduced in the second section of
the piece (Figure 6.7).

Figure 6.7: The five point star which references the five sided pentagon shape.

60

	

The fourth section of the piece is a slight variation of the second section.

The baseline and tom-tom pattern are reintroduced. To link these rhythmic patterns
visually, I return to the upward moving helix, but chose to expand the color palette by
using red and yellow instead of the blue of the previous iteration. This section also
contains two rhythmically different interjections.
The first one is represented by a unique twist
in the double helix strands with no deviation
from the camera’s viewpoint. I attempt to build
on the camera interjections principle instead of
replicating the format used in section two, so the
first rhythmic deviation enhances visual interest by
doing something the audience would not expect.
The second interjection returns to the alternate
camera view from the second section that shows the
audience the entire structure created (Figure 6.8).
This interpretation helps exemplify the complexity
of section four which has two rhythmic interjections
instead of one. The complexity is reinforced by my

Figure 6.8: This is the second
interjection or camera change that
is similar to when the camera first
altered its viewpoint during the
second section of carpe diem

choice to use two different camera scenarios for each rhythmic deviation.
	

The final section is a combination of many different elements from the previous

four sections. There are driving baselines, cymbal hits from the third section, the “rolling
drum” theme, and the rhythmic patterns from sections two and four all thrown into the
last moments of the piece. To distinguish this section from previous ones, I drive the
motion of the camera view to the left. This also serves the purpose of creating a horizon
line that can be used to create another unifying structure in the piece. All the previously
mentioned percussive patterns are re-introduced in this section but they adhere to the
61

leftward motion of the camera’s viewpoint rather than the upward motions of the pervious
sections. Cymbal crashes bring the shockwave rings back and the hollow pentagon shapes
represent louder drum hits (Figure 6.9). Before the final percussive hit in the piece, the
camera pans out so the audience can see five different particle trails racing towards a
single point in the middle of the composition. As the dynamic and rhythmic intensity
builds, the five lines merge into one point and a large white pentagon shape materializes
and expands to cover the entire composition (Figure 6.10). This white pentagon
expansion culminates with the final hit of the piece.
	

Figure 6.9: The return of the cymbal shockwave in the final section of the piece. This
particular instance visualizes the hit from a suspended cymbal.

The Drums Downtown IV animation was an excellent opportunity for me
to explore and polish my skills in MEL scripting. I refined my scripting techniques
by dividing my programming into smaller segments. My scripts were broken down
into two distinct sections. The first section opens the MIDI file and places all of the
data into an array. The second section iterates through this data and executes certain
animations. I discovered that this process can be layered to incorporate multiple different
62

Figure 6.10: The final moment in the Drums Downtown IV animation when all five
lines merge to create a pentagon shape that grows to fill the frame.

animation passes over the same section of music. For example, one script can generate
the white shockwaves in synchronization to the cymbal hits, and in a separate pass, a
script can generate the hollow pentagon animations in synchronization with the higherpitched drum hits. This concept quickly blossomed during my development. The first
animation section uses two scripting passes while the final animation section uses four
scripting passes. This fueled my perception of designing animations in a generative and
layered process.
	

The work explored the association of specific visual elements to recurring

rhythmic patterns in the music and the use of visual space and compositional framing
helped accentuate key moments in music. I attempted to show the audience how rhythmic
patterns continually re-surface and develop throughout a piece of music. The pentagon
was originally introduced in section two, alluded to in section three with the star pattern,
revisited in section four, and used for the various rhythmic pattern reiterations in the
final section. Visual forms like the pentagon, rolling drum pattern, double helix strands,
and camera viewpoint alterations helped to convey rhythmic contrasts, patterns, and
63

developments that occurred throughout the performance. Shockwaves representative of
cymbal crashes and expanding and contracting rings representative of gong hits helped to
visually convey dynamic variations that were prevalent in the performance.
	

The major benefit to creating a pre-rendered animation is the ability to control all

aspects of the design and creation process from the first to the last frame in the animation.
As an artist, I can create a visual theme, execute and develop this theme over time, and
conclude the theme in the same way a composer would explore a musical theme from
exposition, to development, to a concluding restatement. A pre-rendered animation can
be perfectly mated in synchronization and thematic development to a pre-recorded piece
of music. It can function as a visual recording of the music and because the artist is
responsible and in control of all aspects pertaining to the animation’s creation, the final
result can be a perfect translation of the artist’s vision and interpretation of the music. The
artist is responsible for all the aspects in the animation including the concept, design, and
development. The resulting pre-rendered animation will always be the same.
	

The biggest drawback to creating a pre-rendered animation for a synchronized

music performance is that the musicians must conform to the tempo constraints of the
animation. Both percussionists must perform the piece at the exact same speed from
start to finish. All accelerandos and ritardandos must also be performed exactly the same
each time. If the performers deviate from the original tempo used in the creation of the
animation, the entire effect will be ruined by going out of synch. This places a lot of
strain on the musicians, and it limits their ability to vary their interpretation of the music
from one performance to the next.
	

In Drums Downtown IV, both percussionists agreed to perform to a click track.

The click track gave them a solid metronomic pulse for all tempos throughout the piece
including accelerations and decelerations and it created a framework so the percussionists
could consistently replicate their performance. This click track was piped through a
64

separate audio channel and into headphones that the performers were wearing during
the performance. This click track was derived from a previous performance and used to
synchronize the animation. The overall effect was that the visuals were responding to the
percussive beats however, the performers were actually limited to the tempo restraints of
the pre-rendered animation and the pre-determined click track. I was fortunate enough to
be working with two talented percussionists. Their ability and willingness to play along
with the pre-rendered animation was paramount for the proper effect. The percussionists
exemplified consistency and repeatability in their performance, but this is not an ideal
scenario for a music performance. An animation that adapts, adjusts, and responds to
the musicians’ performance would be preferable because the musicians are then free to
adjust, respond, and express their interpretation of the music without being restrained to
the synchronization requirements of a pre-rendered animation.
	

Drums Downtown IV was an excellent intermediate step towards the ultimate

goal of creating real-time music visualizations because I was able to experience my work
in a live performance-based environment. I was able to explore different visual forms and
how they might portray contrasting patterns and rhythmic sequences in a piece of music.
My explorations in camera viewpoints helped to establish the concept of using only one
camera to convey the complete development of the animation. In Drums Downtown IV,
there were no camera cuts, dissolves, or transitions. The music was presented as one
piece to the audience, and I designed the animation to reflect that singular concept of
presentation. All of the camera work in Drums Downtown IV supported this concept by
using one camera that follows the developing visual forms. Alternate camera angles are
used to accentuate contrasting themes or developments in the music, but there are no cuts
between the various viewpoints. This helped create a sense of one work that continuously
develops in the same form as the music. I also became familiar with the limitations of a
pre-rendered animation and its restrictive qualities over a musician’s interpretations and
65

flexibility. This furthered my desire to create an animation that would truly respond to a
musician’s performance.

6.4 Fiddling with Bonk: Building a system to visualize music in a real-time
environment
	

In order to construct a system that responds to a live musical performance, I

abandon the MEL scripting techniques that were previously developed. Developing
in Maya with MEL scripts require extensive rendering times for animation frames
because the rendering systems in Maya are not designed to run in a real-time
environment. There are other software programs that are more adept to creating real-time
environments and animations such as Dassault Systems’ Virtools or Cycling’74 Max/
MSP. Instead of relying on MIDI data, this new system would need to analyze audio in a
real-time setting. Cycling’74 offers a software solution entitled Max/MSP (Cycling’74).
Max/MSP combines the functionality of manipulating MIDI and audio data. Max/MSP
uses a visual programming interface that allows a programmer to connect “patches”,
or specific programming functions, to other patches. An entire network of connected
patches can manipulate data in a real-time environment. Max/MSP includes functions
to manipulate audio waveforms and MIDI data. Data is seamlessly shared, developed,
and passed between audio waveform functions and MIDI functions. Exact pitches,
beats, note durations, and chords that are contained within the MIDI specification are
juxtaposed with the frequency, amplitude, and phasing of the analogue audio waves in
the same programming environment. This software was an excellent launching point for
experimentation and development on a real-time audio analysis system. Max/MSP has
also served as a suitable software platform for many other researchers who work in realtime audio analysis.
	
66

	

Two objects that are of particular interest for my work are the ~Bonk and

~Fiddle objects. These objects were developed by Miller Puckette, Theodore Apel,
and David Zicarelli (Puckette). Fiddle is a pitch detector and Bonk is a beat detector.
These two objects contain algorithms that are capable of determining the approximate
pitch of a monophonic instrument and detecting an attack from a percussive instrument
(Puckette). These objects are one of the foundations for my exploration in real-time audio
analysis. Live audio feeds from a microphone source can be input and analyzed by these
algorithms and the corresponding pitch and beat detections can be output as numerical
data.
	

The first implementation of my real-time audio analysis system in Max/MSP

receives a live audio feed and divides this input source into ten different frequency
bins. These frequency bins subdivide the entire audible range of human hearing from
20 hertz to 20,000 hertz into ten different segments and isolate different spectrums
of the audio signal. The beat detection object, Bonk, is applied to each frequency bin.
This method allows Bonk to focus on a narrower audio range instead of detecting beats
across the entire spectrum. A bass drum attack resonates in the lower frequencies of the
audio spectrum while a cymbal crash or high hat cymbal attack registers in a higher
frequency. Isolating the various frequencies yields two different attacks, one for the
higher pitched instrument and one for the lower pitched instrument. In addition to
multiple attack detections, the severity or strength of the attack can be quantified. For
example, a snare drum rolls out a standard marching cadence and Bonk detects these
attacks within the middle-ranged frequency bins. Now, suppose a bass drum hits at the
beginning and end of the snare drum cadence to denote a new phrase or drum cadence.
The bass drum is detected in the lower frequency bins at the same time the snare drum is
detected in the middle frequencies. By segregating the audio spectrum into ten bands, the
analysis system quantifies the snare drum as a single attack and the snare drum and bass
67

drum combo as two attacks. If a high-pitched cymbal crash were added to this cadence
moment, the system might register three attacks. The quantification of attack strength is a
relatively coarse measurement, but it provides a useful element in determining movement
and pacing within the 3D animation.
	

The use of Fiddle provides an approximate value for the current pitch in the audio

and this data is often used to drive color values in the visualizations or alter movement in
subtle increments. Fiddle has difficulty calculating the pitch of multiple instruments
that are playing simultaneously. Ideally, each instrumentalist should have his or her own
microphone, but this may not be practical in larger ensembles. Fiddle also has limitations
on pitches it can discern. Lower pitches are more difficult to isolate, and it can take a few
seconds for Fiddle to zero in on the correct pitch. These limitations are reflected in my
design choices for animations. I use Fiddle as a rough approximation of pitch with the
understanding that it may not always be accurate, so critical visual forms in the animation
rely on other analytical functions. I did not want the correlation between visuals and
music to appear arbitrary. The use of Fiddle is a concern because it can be difficult to
establish a clear relationship between Fiddle’s output and the actual pitch of the music so
I limit its use to less critical developments in the animation.
	

All of the spectral analysis and pitch information is gathered into the form of

a list and sent to a real-time environment authoring software entitled Virtools using
the Open Sound Control protocol. The Open Sound Control (OSC) protocol is an
open-ended network protocol that provides an interoperable real-time communication
system for the control of sound, musical instruments, and other media processing
instruments (OpenSoundControl). Virtools and Max/MSP offer OSC objects or
building blocks that are compiled for their respective programming languages.
Through OSC, the exact timing of attacks, attack strength, approximate pitch, the
MIDI note associated to that pitch, and peak amplitudes for the ten frequency bands are
68

transmitted to Virtools. Virtools provides additional functionality to manipulate this data
or use it to drive specific functions in a real-time animation.
	

My first iterations in the real time music visualization process focused on the

synchronization of musical attacks to create motions in the animation. I explored the
association of dynamic contrasts in music with dynamic contrasts in visual motions. The
first visualizations focused on a central node that acted as a focal point and controlled the
location of objects around it. Dynamic fluctuations in the music controlled the movement
of this central node, and this scenario was acceptable for visualizing contrasting sections
in the music (Figure 6.11). I continued to build on this structure and began to incorporate
other data streams such as pitch or amplitude values from different audio frequency
segments into the animation. Fiddle’s ability to decipher pitch frequencies was used to
alter the color of objects. The color choice was arbitrary in the first iterations of these
animations. I simply mapped the detected frequencies from Fiddle (20Hz – 20kHz) to the

the central node over time. The lower image shows the entire central node with
some rings surrounding it.

69

visible spectrum of light, because of Fiddle’s limitations with accurate pitch detection.
	

The first real time visualizations suffered from a lack of focus on specific visual

forms and how those forms related to create an overall visual theme. Instead, these early
visualizations served as a means for discovering appropriate music to visual mapping
strategies. I was able to experiment with pitch to color relationships, amplitude variations
to object translations and rotation, and a preliminary camera system that tracked a central
node in the animation. These experimentations helped me discover the importance of
a central node-based system. The central node provides a clear subject for the camera,
and it provides a focal point for the creation of other visual forms. As the central node
moves through the 3D environment, objects are generated in response to the audio data
and positioned relative to the central node. The resulting effect is a trail of objects that
presents a brief snapshot of the audio data as it evolves over time.
	

A focus that develops in these preliminary visualizations is the illustration of a

visual history of music. Audiences were able to witness the generation of an animation
in response to musical data streams and with an alteration of the camera’s viewpoint,
they could see a visual history of what recently occurred in the music. One difficulty in
this setup was the immense amount of data that needed to be visualized. As the music
progressed in time, more and more data needed to be displayed. A long straight line of
objects generated in the animation may be the most obvious choice for a visual history,
but this was not a very inspiring concept for me. A straight line is very predictable, and
not representative of a music performance’s suggestion of curves, jumps, sways, revolves,
and most importantly unpredictable directions that constantly leave the audience wanting
and listening for more. A long line of visual data is also cumbersome and difficult to
navigate. As the line grows longer it becomes increasingly difficult to show the entire line
in detail. No matter how I orient or position the camera, the introductory developments
of a line will always be difficult to see in the compositional frame. Panning away from
70

the line comes at the expense of detail, and it does not effectively use the space within
the frame. To combat these limitations in a straight line, I experimented with wrapping
the visual history around a sphere in the same way yarn is wrapped into a ball. This
solved both problems I had with the straight line approach. Having the line contained
to the surface area of a sphere allows for a more effective use of the compositional
space. Lines remain visible on the backside or the area facing away from the camera in
addition to being visible on the front side or the area facing the camera, so I was able
to effectively use foreground and background space within the composition. It also
added visual interest in the
composition. The curves that
arc throughout the space more
effectively represented the
dynamic qualities of music
and better utilized the space
within the compositional
frame. The overall effect is
demonstrated in the figure
(Figure 6.12).
	

The visual history

of music and wrapping
of data around a sphere
was a principle concept
behind the work which was

The smaller white spheres can occupy the foreground and
background. This is also the first implementation of wrapping a
visual history around a sphere.

demonstrated at the ACCAD open house in 2007. This work consisted of a large blue
sphere that served as the central node in the animation. This central node technically
orbits a larger sphere which was invisible to the audience. This created a more dynamic
71

and seemingly unpredictable path for the central node, and it represents my first use of
hierarchical control structures. A small particle-like system orbits around a larger blue
sphere which orbits around a larger invisible sphere. The combination of three different
orbits creates some unique twists and turns in the developing visual history of music. The
most compelling visuals transpired later in the animation when multi-colored streams
that once represented the current amplitude and pitch of the audio curve, twist, and arc

of the compositional frame to illustrate a visual history.

through the compositional space in a seemingly interconnected web (Figure 6.13).
	

Unfortunately, the animation exhibited some flaws and one unique problem that

actually enhanced the visual history of music. As the animation progressed, the computer
was programmed to periodically clear all the visual history. During the demonstration,
72

the computer failed to clear the visual history and continued far beyond my original
intentions for the animation. The animation became progressively slower and slower
as the particles constantly increased in number. It was during these moments that some
of the most compelling and visually engaging images came about from the hundreds
of colored arcs and twists that dotted the compositional space. The orbiting particle
trails kept the piece visually intriguing by breaking up the space and creating unique
interconnected webs of visual music history. These visual history lines connected the
foreground and background of the composition with some lines periodically filling the
frame while others appeared as tangled meshes in the distance.
	

The animation exemplified one other problem where the central node or blue

sphere remained in the center of the composition at all times. This lacked a dynamic
and variable quality for the composition because the camera was constantly tracking
this central node. I did not want a single static object to be the focus of attention for the
duration of the music piece. Music is never static or stationary so the unchanging view of
this central blue sphere node seemed contrary to the very nature of music.
	

The creation of the particle trail lines which vary their size in response to the

amplitude was a good starting concept for capturing dynamic changes in music. I needed
to refine this concept and emphasize the contrasting qualities of the particle’s size. I
wanted dynamic contrasts to fill the compositional frame. If the music was going to blare
with a deafening intensity of volume, then I wanted a bombastic visual form to accentuate
this moment. This animation represented a significantly tamer version of those dynamic
contrasts. The particle trail does vary in size but it still remained small relative to the
other formations in the composition.
	

The resulting animation may not have visually captured the music in a dramatic

and compelling way, but it did demonstrate an effective system for real time audio
analysis and the generation of an animation in response to that analysis. This system
73

illustrated a developing visual history of music. Thanks to a malfunction in the system,
the animation created a far more intricate and complex visual history than I originally
intended. The system also represented my development process for the construction of
a real time animation system that responds to a live audio source. I focused on technical
issues involved with creating the animation system and refined my process for future
versions. This system increased my desire to create a more dynamic camera system and
to create visual forms that more effectively convey the contrasting dynamics of a live
music performance.

6.5 Arctic Fracture: Real time live performance of Drums Downtown V
	

Arctic Fracture expands on the previous real time visualization system by

addressing my desire to emphasize dynamic contrasts within the compositional frame and
by creating a more complex camera system that better responds to changes in the music.
This animation departs from my concept of creating a complete visual history of music
and focuses more on the immediate reaction the animation has to music. Arctic Fracture
also builds on the strengths of the computer in the real time execution of the animation,
and incorporates multi-channel audio inputs for a more cohesive dynamic visualization
of a live music performance. Additional systems are created to control the camera’s view
and provide support for the artist to manipulate certain aspects of the animation.
	

Drums Downtown V was my second opportunity to collaborate with the OSU

percussion ensemble and their directors Susan Powell and Professor Joseph Krygier.
This work attempted to construct a real-time animation that would respond to a small
percussion ensemble’s performance. This would be a radical departure from last year’s
work where the performers had to conform to the timing constraints of a pre-rendered
animation. The musical piece is entitled Ursprung/gläntor or Origins/Glades by Henrik
Strindberg, and it calls for a small ensemble of six percussionists all performing various
74

hand drums, wind chimes, crotales cymbals, and a Nigerian udu earthenware drum
(Strindberg).
	

My first step was to consider what aspects of the music I would like to analyze

and how the resulting analyzed data streams could be appropriately reflected in a camera
control system. My focus for this real-time music visualization system was to more
effectively illustrate music dynamics and their relationship to the compositional space.
I attempted to improve upon the previous music visualization system and use camera
motions to subtly convey dynamic variations in the music. In order to demonstrate
dynamic variations in the audio, I created a new analysis system in Max/MSP that
provides a measurement of the audio amplitude differential. The system functions as
an audio envelope tracker. It records and quantifies the difference in amplitude values
within the audio signal. This amplitude differential information illustrates an atypical
aspect of amplitude data. Peak meters in audio typically represent decibels or amplitude
values with lighted bars that
increase in number when the
audio amplitude increases
(Figure 6.14). I attempted
to show another aspect
of this data by creating
a system that tracks the
difference in these amplitude
values. A spontaneous or

Figure 6.14: This figure shows a series of audio amplitude peak
meters that represent various frequency segments in the audio
spectrum

loud percussive hit triggers a large reading in the system, but successive loud hits only
trigger a small reading because the difference between their amplitude and the first loud
hit’s amplitude is much less than the difference between an initial loud hit and silence.
This audio envelop tracking system proved to be very effective in capturing the general
75

dynamic contrast in music, and it proved to be an invaluable tool for the operation of the
camera movement in this real time animation system. This audio analysis system was
replicated seven times to provide six discrete audio channels, one for each performer

Figure 6.15: This image depicts four of the six audio channels with some analysis systems visible

in the ensemble and one channel that represents a mix of the six other channels (Figure
6.15). This seventh channel represented the percussion ensemble as a whole, and it was
used to guide the movements and viewpoint of the camera in the animation.
	

The camera rig in this setup is actually very complex in its design. The camera

has a central node that is designated as its target. All of the other visual forms in the
animation are generated relative to this central node or master position marker. The
camera rotates clockwise or counter-clockwise around this node depending on multiple
different factors including the strength of the audio envelop tracker or difference in audio
amplitude and the time difference between detected audio envelops. Quieter music may
have percussive hits that are sparse when compared to a driving rhythmic section where
76

percussive beats are frequent and potentially louder. The camera’s rotational direction and
speed at which it rotates is based on these two factors so softer dynamics result in slower,
subtle camera movements while large dynamic contrasts in the music produce more
energetic motions.
	

To balance the camera’s data-driven motions, some controls are built to help

the artist alter viewpoints as necessary during the live performance. These include the
camera’s pitch (tilt) or height from the subject, zoom distance, and the ability to switch
between different subjects or master nodes at the push of a button. The master node’s
position is governed by the audio envelope tracker, the time difference between detected
envelopes, and some randomized factors based on the audio data streams. Dynamics in
the music dictate the node’s motions throughout the environment.
	

My inspiration for this real time animation system actually hit me during a walk in

the woods after a significant snowfall. I had been listening to the composition by Henrik
Strindberg many times in search of some visual inspiration without any success. During
my walk, I began to notice snowflakes, water drops falling from icicles and I began to
consider how these visual elements might sound. I immediately went home to listen
to the piece. Many of the sounds and instruments in Strindberg’s piece demonstrated a
high-pitched “clink” or “clang” sound. They could almost be construed to the breaking
of icicles or the smashing of ice on a hard concrete floor. The earthen drums presented
a deeper more muffled thump that could be represented by the sound a drop of water
makes when falling into a deep puddle. The inspiration of my winter walk coupled with
the sounds of the instruments in Ursprung/gläntor became the basis for my visual theme.
My research encompassed different pictures of water drops, icicle formations, snow,
frost formation, and ice sculptures. I was particularly intrigued with the splash pattern of
a water drop and how it created a unique formation on impact with the surface of water
(Figure 6.16). I wanted to capture the same moment in time that the picture illustrates
77

Figure 6.16: This inspirational image of a water drop hitting the surface of
water is actually a 3D generated image that was created by Ricardo Lipas
Augusto from Brazil.

audio input.

but with an icy twist. I chose to accentuate the highest arc in the splash formation, and I
asked what if a raindrop were to hit the ground at a 45 degree angle and instantly freeze
afterwards, what would it look like? This concept quickly developed into a crescentshaped splash of ice that would freeze at the apex of its outward thrust (Figure 6.17).
This crescent splash shape quickly snowballed into other formations. I began to create
78

icicles that would grow upwards from the ground like stalagmites, arcs or hook-shaped
formations of ice, crescent-shaped frost patterns, and even ice formations that resembled
sea urchins. The goal was to create a short visual formation of ice that could represent a
dynamic burst of audio, or in the case of this piece, the clang of a cymbal hit. Each visual
formation was unique and able to visually capture a specific percussive hit in a quick
extruding motion. The combination of all the ice formations would create this incredibly
unique and explosive growth that is representative of the percussive instruments in the
piece.
	

Each of these visual ice formations has their own unique animation and a

corresponding HLSL (high level shader language) shader. These HLSL shaders are
developed with a free tool called “Mental Images Mental Mill Artist Edition” which is
packaged with nVidia’s FX composer 2.0 software (Figure 6.18). Shader languages such
as HLSL are programmable instructions that specify how the GPU (graphics processing

HLSL shaders in the Mental Images shader program. The shaders
are then exported to Virtools.

79

unit) manages data as it passes through the 3D pipeline of a graphics card. Functions of
HLSL include vertex processing that can manipulate the vertices of a 3D object or pixel
processing that can manipulate a specific pixel. These effects typically include texture
blending, lighting, and environmental mapping. The combination of vertex and pixel
processing represents the core function of HLSL shaders in DirectX 9.0 (Programming
Guide to HLSL). Mental Images Mental Mill software allows artists to create shaders
through a visual node-based hierarchical system (Mental Images). All of the objects
in my real-time animation are created with shaders I program to look like different
textures of ice. Many of these shaders have exposed parameters that allow the artist and
the programmed systems to alter select elements like color, distortion, brightness, and

and the decisions I make when desiging the real time animation system

transparency. The overall effect is an added level of detail in the generative aspects of this
real-time animation system because their surface textures can be further manipulated by
the programmed systems or controls that are driven by the artist.
	

The programming schematic of Virtools provides a unique perspective on my

process of designing real time music visualizations. The visual scripting interface
can serve to outline some of the choices I make when programming (Figure 6.19).
My thought process relating musical structures to visual forms must start with the
translation of numerical data into a complex sequence of math operations, decision
trees, object generators and transformation controls. I start with a large set of incoming
data previously analyzed in Max/MSP. This numerical data consists of continuously
updating amplitude values for each audio channel, beat detection triggers, pitch values,
and data streams in which attributes of the audio channels are averaged together. By
initially connecting values of the streaming data to the position and rotation values of
temporary markers or placeholders in the 3D scene, it allows me to visually study the
data in motion. I am able to get a sense for the possibilities of how I might conform
the data to control objects and motion suited to my interpretations of the music. From
this stage, I proceed to take control of these resulting motions by manipulating the
incoming data using mathematical calculations to filter the values or by creating new
markers that interpolate between the coarse or erratic motions of the originals to create
smoother motions. I apply threshold or multiplier operations in order to amplify motions
that emphasize gestures that help convey the essence of music I intend to show in the
animation. After the data is under better control, I explore other possibilities of motion
by creating conditional statements that respond to thresholds in the data to determine
different directions or positions in which visual forms are generated. This is an exciting
moment in my development because I can attempt many different permutations of
functions until I arrive at a successful representation of the events occurring in the music.
81

	

As I build the scripts for the computer to autonomously control forms and motion

based on the audio data, I analyze the resulting visuals and decide if creating controls that
allow for manual overrides of the scripts could be important in order to have increased
control over desired output during a live performance. In Arctic Fracture, I determined
that building keyboard input controls that affect operations on the autonomous camera
system could facilitate new viewpoints or interesting camera angles that might not
be possible otherwise. This allows me to take control of the camera position when
the computer drives the camera in a direction I do not approve. Dress rehearsals with
the performing ensemble helped me refine and predict how the autonomous systems
would react to the live audio streams. With additional keyboard controls, I adjusted
the thresholds of the incoming data and their influence over specific motions in the
animation. This process of implementing layers of user control that can modify the
programming in real time allows for both technical problem solving and creative
adaptation to the live performance event.
	

Each percussionist had their own visual representation that responded to

their music part in the ensemble. Since the percussionists were each responsible for
multiple instruments, I decided to make the visual representations modular. Each visual
representation was originally tied to a specific audio channel. The crescent ice splashes
were always associated with audio channel one. Because different percussionists
would be playing the cymbals, I had to create a more flexible system for the visual
representations. The end result is a switching system that allowed me to assign any audio
channel to the crescent ice shape. I could switch the crescent splash cymbal element to
different inputs depending on who was playing the cymbal part at the time or I could
choose to associate the ice formation with the first percussionist in the ensemble. This
flexibility in the assignment of visual elements to audio streams was a choice I made to
balance the analytical capacities of the computer with the conceptual desires of the artist
82

and the artist’s need to adapt during performance. This design choice along with others
such as camera manipulators provided the artist with some control over the real time
animation instead of relying solely on the computer’s ability to manipulate and relate
multiple data streams to specific visuals in the animation.
	

The real time animation system was frequently tested during some of the

percussion ensemble’s rehearsals. Some of the initial challenges included balancing
audio levels between the six microphone inputs and adjusting the visual representation’s
response levels so they would focus on their respective audio input. Microphones would
often pick up audio and noise from the surrounding musicians because the musicians

visualization appearing behind the musicians on stage.

were all sitting close together in a semi-circle. I had to constantly adjust audio level
thresholds so each visual instrument would primarily capture the dynamics from its
specified audio input. After some adjustments to audio levels and balancing between
83

audio inputs, the system was complete and ready for the final performance.
	

The two performances for Drums Downtown V ran successfully and the

animation system responded beautifully to the percussion ensemble (Figure 6.20).
There were some unique observations I made when comparing the development phases
of the real time animation system to the live testing phases of the performances. The
first observation I made was the dramatic difference in dynamics between pre-recorded
audio and live audio. Dynamic intensity and diversity is lost in a recording of music.
During my independent trials of the animation system using pre-recordings, the dynamic
levels were relatively consistent and confined within a narrower amplitude range. Each
visual representation in Arctic Fracture was predominantly driven by the amplitude of
its respective audio source. Pre-recorded audio levels were very easy to work with so
the size, shape, or color of the different visual representations would never expand too
far beyond the compositional frame or visually clip above the color white. In contrast,
live audio has a more expansive dynamic range. When the percussionists were playing
softly, I found myself directing the camera to extreme close-up views just to make the
ice formations visible in the composition. When the dynamics began to increase, I had
to quickly distance the camera from the subject in order to keep portions of it within the
frame. After discovering these extreme dynamic variations during the dress rehearsals, I
decided to implement new limits on various systems that were being driven by amplitude
data. For example, some shaders in the animation used amplitude values to control their
color. I had designed the shaders to vary their shading in response to the limited dynamic
range of recorded music. The dress rehearsal yielded amplitude values that caused many
of these shaders to appear white, so I had to adjust and limit their response to the new
amplitude data. Though I limited the response of shader control systems, I did not limit
the size or motion of the ice formations. My previous visualization work for the ACCAD
open house did not accentuate the dynamic contrasts enough so this was a welcomed
84

change when I saw the new dynamic contrasts in response to the live audio.
	

The second observation I made was the unique interplay that existed between

the different visual ice formations. I found that switching visual representations
between different audio sources was not necessary and probably over-complicated the
visualization. It was fascinating to hear the different percussionist’s dynamics as they
varied, cross-faded, grew, and receded in response to each other. It was even more

Figure 6.21: An image illustrating the dynamic interplay and variation between the
different ice formations

interesting to watch as the different ice formations responded to this varied dynamic
interplay (Figure 6.21). I had developed each of these ice formations to represent specific
performers or instruments and my testing was limited to two-channel recorded audio. The
variable dynamic developments that visually formed between the different ice formations
was not something I had observed during testing and it created an even more compelling
composition. One percussionist would rise to the foreground of the ensemble while other
members receded in intensity to further support this rise. Then another percussionist
or even two ensemble members might rise in intensity while the others faded to the
85

background. This communication that occurred between ensemble members was visually
captured and animated. This was a distinctive visual development in my work, and I no
longer thought it was necessary to attach a specific visual representation to a particular
musical instrument or ensemble member. It was exciting to watch how the dynamic
variations animated and responded to each other through the six different audio inputs
from the ensemble.
	

Arctic Fracture was able to better portray the variations in music dynamics from

subtle fluctuations to drastic changes because I focused on what was happening now in
the music. Instead of long visual histories of music being illustrated in the previous real
time animation system, dynamic changes filled the composition and created a strong
visual impact. The camera rig also supported the visual impact of the animation because
its position was constantly changing in response to the audio data. Additional controls
were incorporated to allow the artist to further manipulate the camera angles to create
top-down perspectives and views from underneath the developing visual formations
which created more variability in the animation. Various incoming data streams like
pitch analysis, amplitude differentials, and multiple audio channels affected to varying
degrees how the central node would move through the environment so the central node
was no longer attached to a predetermined path. This created a more unpredictable and
visually interesting composition. The greater dynamic range of the live audio source
challenged the compositional boundaries of the camera’s view from being barely visible
to completely filling the frame. Visualizing the communication that exists between
musicians during a live performance was an unexpected and welcomed addition to the
animation. This communication added visual complexity to developing forms in the
animation and created an effect I was unable to foresee during my initial development of
the animation system.
	
86

	

Arctic Fracture also demonstrated the use of a computer as a visual instrument for

the artist. Micro-level control systems provided the computer with the functionality to
simultaneously analyze and manipulate six different audio data streams and use that data
to drive scaling, translation, and rotation values for six different ice formations, while the
artist was able to exercise control over macro-level systems like a camera’s viewpoint,
or assigning different ice formations to different audio inputs. The characteristics of
these control systems in the computer combined with my artistic interpretations and
sensibilities allowed me to visually contribute to the music performance with the
computer as my instrument.
	

The programming involved in this real time animation system provides me with

a framework for future development and refinement. I can easily switch ice formations
with falling leaves, bouncing bubbles, or erupting skyscrapers. In future developments,
I can continue refining the camera control system to allow for more flexibility in how
the camera moves in relationship to the central node or build in additional controls
for the artist to manipulate the camera’s position. I can introduce new targets for
focusing the camera instead of relying on just one central node, and the camera can
transition smoothly between these different focal points. Visual formations can develop
simultaneously in different regions of the 3D environment with each formation having
its own unique development while the artist uses the camera to transition between the
different regions. Additional visual formations can be integrated to include more audio
channels, more musicians, and larger ensembles.

CHAPTER 7

CONCLUSIONS

	

My journey as a musical visualization artist started with a highly analytical

approach. My process concentrated on visualizing structure, pattern, and thematic
development with the goal of elucidating these structures to an audience that consisted of
music theorists and musicians. My studies in other artists’ music visualizations like Oscar
Fischinger’s animations, Wilfred’s “Lumias,” and Disney’s Fantasia inspired me to create
animations that would focus on a more interpretative goal that uses visual animations
to depict characteristics of music. My process goals quickly transitioned away from an
analytical to a more interpretative approach. Rather than focusing only on visualizing
complex structures and their development in music, I wanted to share with an audience
the passion I have for music through visual interpretation informed by the emotional
responses that the music and its performance can invoke in listeners. I wanted to illustrate
expressive characteristics of music that would be accessible to everyone so I focused my
efforts on performance-related aspects in music.
	

I became interested in the visual form of music and my views changed from a

concrete and structural interpretation to a more artistic and abstract one. For me, music
represented a moving, fluidic, and ethereal form that expanded and contracted in the
space of an imagined concert hall. This ethereal representation can take on many different
forms from solid spikes like a sea urchin to the gentle downpour of water flowing over
some rocks. This ethereal form of music represented the basis for all of my design
88

decisions, and it is something I have tried to capture in all my animations. I consider this
form to be the overarching visual concept in all my works, and I have tried to illustrate
this form in my animations.
	

I focused my efforts on music dynamics and how they could affect visual

formations in the animation. I also tried to incorporate my understanding of themes and
structures in music into the visual images. Rather than using my knowledge of themes
and structures as the principal basis for my animation, I chose to use them as a subtle
influence on the choices I made when creating the animation. I figured that if patterns and
themes could provide a structural foundation for music, perhaps these qualities could be
instilled into my visual creations. Considering audible patterns and themes in the music
helped me to create a framework for the development of my visual references.
	

All throughout this process the computer functioned as a tool in the conventional

sense that it only functioned to help the artist create a music animation. The computer
had no creative input during the execution of that music animation. When my
process evolved to creating real time music visualizations in a live performance-based
environment, my initial concept of the computer as a complex tool changed. As I
continued to explore the characteristics of a live music performance, it became clear
to me that I would need to include the role of the artist who could modify the visuals
in response to the music in a real time setting. My earlier works used the computer as
an instrument to create music visualizations with no creative input by the artist or the
computer during the execution of that animation. During a performance I hit the “play”
button and the computer performed in the exact manner in which I had programmed it.
Though this was sufficient for my earlier works, I wanted to create a more interactive
process between the performing musicians and the visual artist. I realized at this juncture
that the computer could be more than just a player piano. It could become a piano. I
discovered that the computer’s programming could be greatly enhanced with the input
89

of an artist. I utilized the computer’s generative capabilities and combined that with my
artistic sensibilities to create a work that could truly respond to a live music performance.
The computer could become a visual instrument for the artist to play.
	

I discovered which aspects of the animation would be suitable for computer

control and which aspects should be reserved for the artist. I built a workflow and
a programming concept that revolves around multiple iterative visual formations. I
developed an autonomous camera control system for my animations that subtly adjusts
to audio data. The result was a camera system that constantly reconstructed the frame of
the composition and functioned like an organism that hovered over the developing visuals
in the animation. The camera was constantly moving, rotating, and adjusting in subtle
motions to the incoming audio data.
	

An interesting observation I made during the performances was that the system

and the camera movements were mostly invisible to the audience. Instead, the focus
of the audience was on how the visuals unfolded within the composition, not on how
the camera system had a significant impact on the perspective of the composition. The
compositional frame was constantly being altered which created a more organic feel to
the visual forms within the animation. The developing visual formations in the animation
were never viewed from the same position so it fueled the perception of the visual images
being in a state of constant evolution which paralleled the evolutionary nature of music.
	

Prior to the performance, I made specific artistic choices about the visual elements

available for the computer’s use during the performance. These included decisions about
shapes, patterns, and potential directions the visualization might take. In the beginning
phases of development for all of my animations, I remained distant from the musicians
and their weekly rehearsals. In one respect, this was necessary because I needed to design
the visuals for the animation and program the control systems. On the other hand, it
would be interesting to see how my role would differ if I had the opportunity to converse
90

with the musicians and attend all of their rehearsals. Integrating the visuals with the
music rehearsals occurred in the later phase of our collaboration because time was a
constricting factor for both parties.
	

My role during the performance was to support the musicians by creating

and building visual interest in the compositional frame. At times I would override
autonomous systems like the camera rig to introduce a unique or different perspective on
the developing visuals. When the music made a significant stylistic or thematic change,
I would key in an appropriate change in the visual form to respond to these differences.
I used my understanding of the music to visually enhance the thematic developments in
the music and create an animation that would accentuate certain musical elements like
dynamics, unique rhythmic patterns, or thematic statements in the ongoing performance.
	

The notion of the computer as a visual instrument has led me to discover my role

as the real time visualization artist who “plays” it. My drive to create a visual work that
truly represents a live music performance pushed me to create an instrument of my own. I
discovered that the computer can be a powerful and complex instrument, but it still needs
the interpretative input of an artist. In my work I will always reserve the most critical and
conceptual developments in the visualization of the music for the artist to control. The
computer can be programmed to accommodate and effectively respond to a live music
performance, but the instinctual and expressive interpretations of an artist cannot be
replaced.
	

In future work, I hope to further develop this concept of the computer as a visual

instrument. I would like to elevate its role in a performing ensemble. Instead of just
visually reacting to the musician’s performance on stage, I think it would be exciting
to explore the interplay of musicians responding to a visual artist’s interpretations. The
visual artist can use the computer as his or her instrument and potentially take new
directions in a live visualization of music. The musicians would in turn respond to these
91

new visualizations. The musicians and the artist could play off each other to create a
truly interactive work in a live performance setting. Jazz music has sections where the
musicians can improvise and dynamically construct melodies based on a progression of
chords. The jazz musicians often call and respond to each other by borrowing melodies,
sharing short motifs, and reconstructing rhythms to create a dynamic, original musical
performance. This interplay that exists between musicians could be expanded to
encompass a visual artist. As a contributing member of the ensemble, the artist could use
the computer as his or her instrument to interpret the music while the musicians respond
to the developing visuals. I envision a developing role for the computer as a visual
instrument in a musical performance as I continue my lifelong pursuit of creating real
time music visualizations.
