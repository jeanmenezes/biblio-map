tra-musical information [4], including user-studies and
human-computer interaction studies of music systems. To
date, most research in MIR has been content-based [5].
In 2000, MIR was still a fairly new field with a great
deal of potential that was gaining the interest of researchers from many different domains. Although ISMIR
started as a small-scale symposium, it has grown immensely over the past nine years as more people have
recognized the importance of MIR research and have
been drawn in to the field. The community has grown to
the point of establishing the International Society for Music Information Retrieval, which will help orient, organize, and disseminate the community‟s future research.
We performed various informetric analyses on the
ISMIR proceedings from 2000 to 2008 in order to discover how the patterns of publications have changed over
the past nine years. Through these analyses, we hope to
obtain insights into what the ISMIR community has and
has not been able to accomplish and which directions it
could be heading towards in the coming years.
In the following, we provide descriptive statistics
showing the change in the number of publications and
authorship patterns over the past nine years. We also provide the results of our analysis of the title terms, looking
at the most commonly used single terms as well as bigrams. In addition, we performed analyses on the citation
patterns among the publications and authors who have
published in the ISMIR proceedings.

ABSTRACT
This paper presents analyses of peer-reviewed papers and
posters published in the past nine years of ISMIR proceedings: examining publication and authorship practices,
topics and titles of research, as well as the citation patterns among the ISMIR proceedings. The main objective
is to provide an overview of the progress made over the
past nine years in the ISMIR community and to obtain
some insights into where the community should be heading in the coming years. Overall, the ISMIR community
has grown considerably over the past nine years, both in
the number of papers and posters published each year, as
well as the number of authors contributing. Furthermore,
the amount of collaboration among authors, as reflected
in co-authorship, has increased. Main areas of research
are revealed by an analysis of most commonly used title
terms. Also, major authors and research groups are identified by analyzing the co-authorship and citation patterns
in ISMIR proceedings.
1. INTRODUCTION
This year, 2009, marks the tenth iteration of the International Symposium on Music Information Retrieval conference series (ISMIR). ISMIR was organized with the
hope that the “resulting information interchange will enable scholars to move more quickly towards viable solutions to many problems” [1] in the field of Music Information Retrieval (MIR).
Futrelle & Downie [2] defined MIR as “a rapidly
growing interdisciplinary research area encompassing
computer science and information retrieval, musicology
and music theory, audio engineering and digital signal
processing, cognitive science, library science, publishing,
and law. Its agenda, roughly, is to develop ways of managing collections of musical material for preservation,
access, research, and other uses”. Necessarily, MIR spans
both audio and symbolic representations of music [3], but
also includes musical metadata, usage data, and other ex-

2. GROWTH OF THE ISMIR COMMUNITY
The first ISMIR conference had just 10 refereed papers
and 16 posters representing 55 authors, with several other
scholars presenting invited talks. To date, 881 authors
have contributed peer-reviewed papers and posters to the
ISMIR proceedings, not to mention the numerous participants in the annual Music Information Retrieval Evaluation eXchange (MIREX), conference workshops, demonstrations, tutorials, and invited talks. The rapid growth in
participation has been paralleled by a similar increase in
the number of papers and posters accepted to ISMIR. In
total, over 700 peer-reviewed papers and posters have
been published, comprising a substantial literature on a
breadth of topics ranging from signal-processing techniques to user studies of MIR systems.

However, the number of papers with three authors has
steadily increased year-over-year. The average number of
co-authors on papers and posters published each year has
increased over the past nine years, from an average of
2.27 authors per publication in 2000 to 2.93 authors per
publication in 2008. Clearly ISMIR is becoming a much
more collaborative community as the number of authors
per paper increases, and the proportion of single, and
double-authored papers diminishes in favor of papers
with three or more authors.

2.1 Change in the Number of Publications per Year
The number of publications in ISMIR proceedings has
been steadily increasing over the past nine years. Exact
numbers are presented in Table 1 along with the number
of unique authors published in each year.

We can better observe the changes in the proportion of
papers and posters for each year, as well as the changes in
the number of authors. The number of publications almost doubled in 2004, jumping from 47 in 2003 to 104.
In 2008, there was a change in the submission format and
all paper submissions were to have accompanying posters
as well. Looking at the number of authors, we can see
that there were two sharp increases in 2002 and 2004, and
a major drop in 2006. However, the overall number of
authors represented at the conference each year has generally grown over the past nine years.
Figure 1 shows the authorship trends within the ISMIR
proceedings, tracking the proportion of papers with one,
two, three, four, and five-or-more authors. As can be
seen, the number of single-authored papers has decreased
year-over-year. The number of papers with two coauthors peaked in 2002, and has steadily declined since.

2.2 Co-authorship Analysis
We performed an analysis to identify the patterns of coauthorship among all the authors who published in
ISMIR proceedings and determine which authors appear
as the central hubs in the co-authorship graph. Figure 2

was generated by using Pajek which is a social networking analysis and visualization tool [6]. In this figure, only
the authors who published 2 or more papers/posters are
included in order to simplify the network.
Several main clusters of people can be visually identified in the figure showing the close connections among
some authors. The top 22 authors with the largest number
of distinct co-authors (12+) are labeled in the figure. Often these authors represent an active research group such
as National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and
Technology (AIST) headed by M. Goto in Japan, The International Music Information Retrieval Systems Evaluation Laboratory (IMIRSEL) headed by J. S. Downie in
Illinois, Distributed Digital Music Archives and Libraries
headed by I. Fujinaga in Canada, the Center for Digital
Music headed by Mark Sandler in London, and so on.
What is evident from these analyses is the growing
role of research labs in the ISMIR community, and how
they engender collaboration and increase participation in
research. Many European labs and research groups are
tightly interconnected, and are difficult to distinguish one
from the other based on the co-authorship patterns. Furthermore, not all evidence of collaboration is represented
in the co-authorship network; for example, the IMIRSEL
lab appears relatively isolated, despite their central role in
organizing MIREX. Large, intercontinental, multiinstitutional grant projects, such as the Networked Environment for Music Analysis (NEMA) project [7], may
start to change the shape of collaboration within the
ISMIR community.

In this section, we present an analysis of terms extracted
from the titles and abstracts of ISMIR papers. Only title
and abstract terms were used as these represent concise
summaries of the papers‟ content.
3.1 The Most Commonly Used Title Terms
In order to get an idea as to which research areas have
been of interest over the past nine years, we analyzed the
title terms of all peer-reviewed papers and posters in the
ISMIR proceedings. All the terms from the titles of the
papers and posters were extracted. The words were
stemmed using a Perl-based implementation of the Porter
stemming algorithm [8], and stop-words were removed
using a combination of a standard list of common-usage
English-language words, with the stop-word “music”, as
this term appears in almost all titles in the ISMIR proceedings. Table 2 shows the top terms that appeared in
the publication titles for each year. New terms entering
the top-ranked lists are highlighted in bold-face.
From the table, we can observe that the most often
used title terms were relatively similar for each year;
however, it is possible to identify certain trends. For instance, there was a strong interest in query by singing/humming systems in 2002 and 2003 shown by the
title term query (“queri”) appearing only in the lists of
these two years. Research interest in musical genres increased in 2005 and 2006, and interest in music similarity
research peaked in 2006. Interest in classification and
modeling has been consistent over the past nine years.
Additionally, the consistently high rank of the term “audio” suggests that ISMIR researchers have been focused
primarily on audio rather than symbolic representations.
What is also evident from the title terms, is how closely the field has stuck to the original framing of MIR as
represented in the 2000 ISMIR program. The core concepts have remained prevalent throughout the past dec-

3. RESEARCH TOPICS IN ISMIR
The topics explored in the first ISMIR conference laid
the foundation for the future growth and evolution of the
field. While ISMIR has grown, it has remained true to the
original vision laid out in the early conference programs.

ade, yet have accommodated expansion into new areas.

by the bi-gram analysis to be fairly representative of the
major research interests in the field: such as “music similarity”, “feature extraction”, and so on.

3.2 Title and Abstract Bi-grams
Single-term-concepts present a limited view of research
concepts and topics, especially after subtle differences in
terms are merged by stemming (e.g., „using‟ and „users‟
have the same stem, „us‟, yet carry different connotations
in usage). Furthermore, the limited text available in titles,
only provides a glimpse at the complexity of concepts
and ideas being researched and published. In order to get
at more specific concepts which have taken the interest of
ISMIR researchers, we extracted stemmed bi-grams (i.e.,
2-word phrases) from the titles and abstracts of all papers
and posters. Initially, we examined the bi-grams on a
year-by-year basis, much as we did for single term
concepts. However, as expected, the number of bi-grams
exceeds the number of uni-grams, and the frequency with
which any one bi-gram occurs is much lower. No
meaningful or interesting patterns arose in the yearly
analysis; however, when considered in aggregate, there is
stronger evidence of dominant research topics within the
field. Table 3 shows the top 20 most commonly used bigrams in ISMIR proceedings over the last nine years.

Moving beyond terms and bi-grams as representations of
research interests, the papers themselves published in the
ISMIR proceedings serve as representations of research
topics and areas, and references to them serve as a way of
highlighting the prevailing research interests of the community. Weinstock [9] outlines 15 motivations for why
academics cite each other in scholarly writing including
paying homage to pioneers, giving credit for related work,
and so on. We examined the references lists of all peerreviewed ISMIR papers and posters, and looked for references to other peer-reviewed ISMIR papers and posters.
We did not consider references to demos, invited talks,
tutorials, MIREX abstracts, or workshop papers. We also
did not attempt to measure references to publications outside the ISMIR proceedings, nor did we attempt to gauge
the number of citations to ISMIR papers from outside.
First, we shall outline and describe the general citation
behavior of the ISMIR community. Figure 3 shows the
frequency distribution of publications by the number of
references to other ISMIR publications they contain.
Most ISMIR papers and posters (nearly 50%) do not reference any other ISMIR publications. The average number of ISMIR references per paper/poster was 1.278 with
the standard deviation of 2.05 and the maximum of 27.

Figure 3. Number of ISMIR references in ISMIR papers
The reasons for low internal referencing within the
ISMIR community may be due to the fact that some authors preferentially cite journals, books, and theses which
are extensions of, or refinements of ideas initially published in ISMIR over the ISMIR publications. Other
possible explanations include the fact that ISMIR proceedings are not indexed in commonly used digital library portals, such as the ACM Digital Library or CiteSeer, and are inconsistently indexed by Google Scholar.
The fantastic resource on http://www.ismir.net/, which
has been developed and maintained by Michael Fingerhut, contains a near-complete set of the full-text versions
of all papers and posters published in the ISMIR proceed-

titles and abstracts, reflecting the main research foci, methods, and approaches of the ISMIR community.
The most common bi-gram is “information retrieval”,
followed by “content based”, “genre classification”, and
so on. Beyond these, we can see the prevalence of the
web, and web-based systems, which has paralleled the
emergence of “web 2.0” and greater access to music and
music systems online within the commercial sector. Although the frequencies of occurrence of some individual
concepts are low, overall we find the topics represented

ings; however, it lacks full-text search capabilities itself,
and the site does not provide complete, standardized metadata records which may improve the visibility of ISMIR
papers in search engines, and digital library portals.

introducing the RWC database, garnering 21 references.
Following Weinstock‟s taxonomy of citer motivation, the
referencing of a data set is most like motivation three:
identifying methodology, equipment, etc. The lack of
standardized data sets with ground truth is a recurring
problem in the MIR community and the RWC database
has served as a valuable resource for MIR researchers, as
it acts as a de facto standardized collection on which to
build and evaluate systems. In fact, the presence of Goto,
et al., 2003, and Ellis, et al., 2002 on this list reiterate the
importance of standardized data sets with ground truth
within MIR research.
There are several other methodological references, including references to Logan (2000), Tzanetakis, et al.
(2001), Sheh & Ellis (2003), Goto, et al. (2003). There
are also elements of “paying homage” in the references to
several papers, especially the seminal work of Beth Logan, who introduced MFCCs to the MIR community.

Without a more in-depth analysis of the individual
contexts surrounding each citation, it is difficult to tease
out the precise motivations for all the references. Regardless, the most referenced works comprise a diversity of
topics and areas which span the breadth of research within MIR, including references to signal-processing algorithms and methods as well as techniques for handling
symbolic representations of music. There are papers covering music transcription, and rhythm analysis, as well as
high-level tasks such as genre-classification, search and
recommendation algorithms, and approaches to understanding audio similarity.
Table 5 shows the top 20 cited authors excluding self
references. The second column shows the count of coauthors each of these authors have in ISMIR proceedings
and the third column shows the count of papers/posters
each author published. The most heavily cited author was

Working with the references we were able to extract,
we filtered self-citations, which we defined as a reference
to a paper in which an author of the citing paper is an author on the referenced paper. Table 4 shows the top cited
papers and posters in the ISMIR proceedings, ranked by
the number of references we were able to find to each.
Among the top cited papers and posters, there is a diversity of topics and publications, from which we may
infer a range of motivations. The most cited publication
in the ISMIR proceedings is Goto, et al.‟s 2002 poster

Masataka Goto with 43 references by other ISMIR authors. Among these top-cited authors, we can see there
are those who have many references, in part because they
have published many papers (e.g., Goto; Widmer), and
there are authors who are highly cited, but have only a
few publications (e.g., Logan; Whitman). There is, however, no correlation (r=0.021) between reference count
and paper count, indicating that the referencing of authors
is not merely a product of their productivity within the
community. It is worth noting that among the top-cited
authors, there is a strong correlation between the number
of co-authors an author has, and the number of papers
he/she has written (r=0.815). This correlation is not that
surprising given our findings from section 2 where we
discussed the trend towards collaboration and coauthorship among ISMIR authors.

our citation analysis, and track the number of ISMIR references found in other related journals and proceedings,
references that are not from ISMIR proceedings and so
on. Additionally, we explored several clustering analyses
in researching this paper, and none provided immediately
compelling results. We would like to continue to explore
how papers, authors, and research topics cluster based on
semantic similarity, co-authorship patterns, citation patterns, and bibliographic coupling.
6. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
We would like to acknowledge the work of Michael Fingerhut in maintaining the ISMIR proceedings database
(http://ismir.net/), which was our primary resource for
locating all of the publications, and was vital to verifying
our data integrity; we are very thankful for his diligence.
We also thank the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation for its
financial support.

5. CONCLUSION
The ISMIR community has grown significantly, and
through the contributions of nearly 900 researchers, the
field of Music Information Retrieval has been welldefined and established. The community is a tightly-knit
one, with a high-degree of collaboration and coauthorship, focused around a core set of research topics
and areas.
The main insights of our analyses can be summarized
as follows:
1) The ISMIR community is becoming more collaborative as shown by increasing co-authorship;
2) The role of research labs is growing in the ISMIR
community as they promote collaboration and increased participation in research;
3) The focus of research has mainly been on audio so
far as revealed by the most commonly used title
and abstract terms;
4) The most cited works in the ISMIR proceedings
comprise a variety of topics, but primarily point to
datasets, techniques, and methods;
In their early ISMIR paper discussing the interdisciplinary communities and research issues, Futrelle and
Downie [2] lists several key research areas in MIR.
Among these, our analyses show that areas such as feature detection and classification/machine learning have
been the major topics represented to date in the ISMIR
proceedings, whereas topics such as user studies, metadata, work on symbolic representations, and epistemology/ontology have not been as well represented as others.
Our advice for the sustained, future growth of the ISMIR
community is to encourage greater activity in these areas,
as they are relatively uncrowded, open topics of research
in which great advances can be made.
We would like to continue our informetric analysis of
MIR research, and there are several aspects that can be
further analyzed to obtain a broader picture of MIR. One
area in which we could improve our understanding of the
domain, is to include external sources and references in
