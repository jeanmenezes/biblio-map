THE

ORIGINS

Introduc tion
Harmonic analysis is the study of the individual chords or
harmonies in a piece of music, together with their use in
succession to form larger units of phrases, periods, sections, or whole compositions.

Weber (1779-1839), since his use of roman numerals is the
model for current methods of notating harmonies in relation
to a tonal center.
I Rameau and the Fundamental Bass
One of the most important features of Rameau's theoretical
writings is his attempt to show how all chords used in the music
of his day are related to one of two fundamental harmonies. *4
These harmonies are the perfect triad, which can be either
major or minor, and the dissonant seventh chord, which is derived from the triad by the addition of a major or minor third.
All other chords are shown to be derived from one of these
two by inversion or by supposition.
According to Rameau's
definitionof chord inversion, all chords related by this principle represent the same harmony and thus have the same root;
this concept is an important contribution to the development of
harmonic theory. The chords of supposition are those which
are formed by the addition of a third or fifth below the root of
a dissonant seventh chord. This process of derivation was the
direct result of Rameau's effort to explain the origin of chords
larger than an octave, the limit he had set for fundamental

As will be seen in the following discussion,

from counterpoint. :5
To demonstrate his principles of harmony, Rameau invented

indicates the relationship between successive chords (the harmonic progression) as well as the root of each generating harmony. In his TRAITE DE L'HARMONIE (1722), Rameau provides the following rules for the progression of the fundamental
bass:

fact that this arises from a license introduced by the deceptive cadence. . .we may note that this ascending (but
not descending) tone or semitone is the inversion of the
seventh heard between the two sounds forming the tone or
semitone. *6
Rameau's use of this device to explain the harmonic structure
of musical compositions (or parts of compositions) can be considered the beginning of harmonic analysis.
However, it should
be pointed out that his intention was not to analyze specific
pieces of music, but rather to demonstrate the validity of his
harmonic theories.
In fact, there are only two instances in all
of his theoretical works where the fundamental bass is given
for an entire composition.
The first of these-an

D'Armide from Lully's opera, ARMIDE; it appears in the
NOUVEAU SYSTEME DE MUSIQUE THEORIQUE (1726).'-*8 For
the sake of space, only the first of these will be considered
here.
The first part (mm. 1-54) of Rameau's analysis of his Laboravi
Clamans is reproduced in Example 1. *9 Examination of the
fundamental bass reveals that, for the most part, the harmonic

Thus the resulting progression is by ascending
fifth, rather than by descending second. This last progression
is called an "irregular cadence" by Rameau. *10
A clear example of double employment appears in mm. 22-23.
The six-five chord on G in m. 22 is interpreted as a fundamental harmony, while the same chord in the following measure is

The result of Schulz's misinterpretation of these notes is that his fundamental bass contains
more harmonies than are implied in the music.

harmonic analysis was made by Gottfried Weber (1779-1839).

introduced a new method of indicating fundamental harmonies.
In place of the fundamental bass, he proposed the use of roman
numerals to indicate harmonies in their relationship to a tonal
center. '24 The advantages of this system over the fundamental
bass are clear.
First, the roman numeral indicates both the

Example 4. Examination of this analysis reveals that Weber's
conception of harmony is much more like Kirnberger's than
Rameau's. Note for example his interpretation of the 9-8 suspension in m. 6 (or the 4-3 in m. 12) as representing a single

this respect, note his interpretation of the parallel sixth chords
in mm. 2-3 and mm. 18-19. Here he has assigned a roman numeral to every chord, thus implying that each functions as a
separate harmony. But in reality the chords in m. 3 (or m. 19)
extend a single harmony (G) as preparation for the following
dominant. *26 This analysis also demonstrates Weber's method
of relating all harmonies to their proper tonal center; as a re-

29g
suit, the analysis outlines his interpretation of the composition's modulatory scheme. But many of the so-called modulations indicated involve only two or three chords; in fact, there
are thirteen separate key changes indicated in the last twenty
measures.
This points to a weakness in his system, namely,
its failure to differentiate between actual modulation and the
use of "secondary dominants" to stress important harmonies.
Weber's approach to harmonic analysis had an immediate effect
on other theorists. :*27 This influence grew steadily to the point
where the use of roman numerals became an integral part of
harmonic theory. One need only thumb through the standard
textbooks on harmony published in the past twenty-five years
to see this. In fact, one would find that, with few exceptions,
there has been little change in the approach to harmony and
harmonic analysis since Weber's time. For this reason, there
is no need to dwell any further here on his contributions.
Concluding Remarks
In the preceding discussion,
an attempt has been made to indicate the roles played by Rameau, Kirnberger and Weber in
the formulation of our present concept of harmony and harmonic
analysis.
Many of the comments have stressed the weaknesses
in their approaches and the negative aspects of their influence.
This does not imply that their theories are without merit; rather,
it should be stressed that all three made significant contributions to harmonic theory.

lost sight of the interaction between harmony and melody.
Finally, it has been noted that Weber's use of roman numerals
is an improvement on the fundamentalbass as a means of showing
the fundamental harmonies in a composition.

and Kirnberger, he was interested in showing only the most

Schenker's objections to traditional music theory are clearly expressed in his
essay, "Rameau oder Beethoven?

Musik", DAS MEISTERWERK IN DER MUSIK, JAHRBUCH 111(1930). A translation of this. article is available in Sylvan Kalib's THIRTEEN ESSAYS FROM
THE THREE YEARBOOKS "DAS MEISTERWERK IN DER MUSIK" BY HEINRICH
SCHENKER: AN ANNOTATED TRANSLATION (Ph.D Dissertation:
Northwestern University, 1973).
An important feature of Schenker's theories is his distinction between chord
and harmony (scale-step).
Since a harmony may include a number of different
chords in succession, not all of them can be considered as representatives of
that harmony; some must be seen as existing for contrapuntal reasons.
Thus
voice-leading (counterpoint) is shown as the means by which harmonies are unfolded in time. This interaction between harmony and counterpoint is evident
in the analyses of Schenker and his followers.
Since their purpose is to reveal
the tonal fabric of individual compositions, they might be called "structural"as opposed to purely "harmonic"-analyses.

Rameau's theoretical approach to harmony and the classification of chords is
totally different from the practically oriented approach of the figured bass
theorists.
Rameau was interested in discovering the acoustical and mathematical laws which govern harmonic connection and the generation of chords.
By contrast, the figured bass theorists of that period were primarily concerned
with classifying the various signatures in such a way that they could be learned
most readily by accompanists.

Rameau's discussion of this piece appears in chapter 44, "On Design, Imitation, and Fugue, " at the end of Book III ("Principles of Composition"). He explains that it contains four different fugues (a quadruple fugue), according to

Differences between the approaches of Rameau and Kirnberger to harmony and
harmonic analysis are discussed by William Mitchell in his article, "Chord
and Context in 18th-Century Theory, " JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MUSICOLOGICAL SOCIETY, 16(1963), 221-239.

15

In his VERSUCH UBER DIE MUSIKALISCHE TEMPERATUR, NEBST EINEM
ANHANG UBER DEN RAMEAU- UND KIRNBERGERSCHEN GRUNDBASS (1776),
Marpurg took Kirnberger to task for adopting Rameau's fundamental bass for
his own purposes. Although many of Marpurg's specific criticisms were justified, there is no reason why Kirnberger should not have used this device as he
saw fit.

16

According to Kirnberger, there are three types of seventh chords: (1) the essential (where the seventh is part of the harmony and resolves with a change
of harmony), (2) the non-essential (where the seventh is a suspension and resolves over the same harmony), and (3) the unauthentic (where the seventh is
non-essential, but its resolution is delayed until the following harmony). (This
last type occurs only with seventh chords built on the leading tone of a key. )
Thus, while the unauthentic seventh chord has the appearance of an essential
one, it is really a special type of non-essential chord. And since the seventh
stands in the place of the sixth, the real root of an unauthentic seventh chord
is a major third below the apparent root.
There are numerous examples of all three types of seventh chord in this analysis (Example 2a). One example of the unauthentic type appears in m. 31. Here
the root of the diminished seventh chord d#-(f#)-a-c is shown to be B, not d#.
Thus "c", while the seventh of the actual chord, is really the non-essential
ninth above the root of the generating harmony; hence the figures $.

17

Kirnberger considered the interval of a diminished fifth between scale degrees
2 and 6 in a minor mode-as
opposed to the one between the leading tone and
scale degree 4-to be consonant.
He made this distinction on the basis of his
own system of tuning, which is similar to Pythagorean tuning.

Kollmann, a native German, spent most of his life in England, where he was

was actually the first to use roman numerals in this way. (See his HANDBUCH
ZUR HARMONIELEHRE UND FUR DEN GENERALBASS (1802).) However, it
was Weber who established their use in a systematic manner.

25

Note that Weber excludes certain chords from the list of those appropriate to a
minor key. In the key of a minor, for instance, he considers but rejects the
following chords on the basis that they are not fundamental harmonies: the
on scale degree 1, the triad (c,e, g) onscale degree
seventh chord (a,c,e,gf)
3, the seventh chord (c,e, g,b) on scale degree 3, and the seventh chord
(gf,b, d, f) on scale degree 7. All contain the leading tone, which according to
Weber, is a necessary element in all keys. For this reason he does not consider those chords which contain the lowered (natural) scale degree 7; they belong to some other key.

For a more detailed discussion of the functions of parallel sixth chords, see
Chapter II in Allen Forte's TONAL HARMONY IN CONCEPT AND PRACTICE,
2nd edition (New York, 1974).

See, for example, Friedrich Schneider's
UND TONSETZKUNST (1820).

This does not mean, of course, that Schenker was opposed to the views of all
and
earlier theorists. His conception of the relationship between voice-leading
vertical structure, for example, was influenced to some extent by C.P.E.
Bach's views on that subject.

This analysis was originally published in the ANHANG (Example 48) of Schenker's
last work, DER FREIE SATZ (1935). In Example 5, the German terms have
either been translated or omitted entirely, as seemed most appropriate.
