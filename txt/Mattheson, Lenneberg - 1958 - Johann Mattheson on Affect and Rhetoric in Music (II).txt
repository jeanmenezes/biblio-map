Elaboration, and
Concerning the Disposition,
Decoration of Melodies
(Selections from Part II, Chapter XIV)

This, however, is not true. Invention itself is not enough
composition.
even though it may solve half the problem, for [it is true that] there
must be invention to begin with. A good beginning is half the job. There
is a proverb that says, "All's well that ends well!' To fulfill it, disand decoration - in terms of rhetoric, dispoposition, elaboration,
sitio, elaboratio, et decoratio - are necessary. 71 While these terms
have been mentioned above, a fuller explanation follows here.
2. There are many who begin something with such generosity
that they cannot keep it up. Horace complained about this already in
his day when he said, "It was begun as a wine-jug and ended as a waterpot!'* There are many examples of composers who have a wealth of
invention, but whose fire always goes out very quickly. They neglect
to dispose their material carefully by never giving it a thought and thus
they never work out anything and cannot keep anything up to the end.
Marcello knows better than this, as we shall soon see.
3. Other composers
pick up whatever inventions they come
across; usually only the smallest part of them is their own. However,
they are clever and dispose, elaborate and decorate their plagiarisms
so well that it is a pleasure to watch them at work.- If I had to make a
choice between good invention and clever elaboration, etc., I might
choose the former. I should prefer, however, to have both at the same
time. This combination of qualities, alas, is as rare as a person of
both beauty and virtue.
4. First, let us consider disposition which consists of the nice
ordering of all the parts and circumstances
of a melody or an entire
work. It is somewhat similar to a building plan, which is drawn, designed, and sketched to show where a hall, a room, a chamber, etc.,
71. The meaning of these terms will become clear in the course
of this chapter.
* Amphora coepit instituti; currente rota cur urceus exit?

medium, 73 for it must observe the same six parts as does a speaker:
confirmation,
and
introduction,
narration,
proposition,

confirmatio,
close; [i.e.] exordium, narratio, propositio,

et peroratio.
5. The earliest composers gave just as little thought to the above
order as did the untutored naturally gifted speaker before rhetoric became a formal science and an art. In fact, despite its correctness,
the

denied that in the careful examination of good speeches as well as good
melodies one can meet these parts - or, at least, most of them following each other in good sequence; despite the fact that most of the
authors would as soon have given thought to their death as to such
This is especially true of musicians.
guides.
6. Even in common conversation nature teaches us to use certain
tropes74, certain suggested meanings of words, certain arguments or
reasons, and to keep them in some order even though the speaker may
never have heard of rhetorical rules or figures.
This very natural
mental instinct, which causes us to present everything in good order
and form, has given certain clever heads the basis for their rules.
Up
to now the outlook in this respect has been dark in the field of music.
We hope that it will gradually grow lighter and we shall try to make a
contribution toward this goal.
7. Exordium is the introduction and beginning of a melody in
which its purpose and intention are shown in order to prepare the
listener and to arouse his attention.
In a movement without instruments, for voice and bass only, the introduction is very often contained
in the prelude of the thorough-bass.
When there is more than this ac[the introduction] is found in the ritornello.
We call
companiment,
ritornello the part first played bythe instruments, since it later serves
as a return [Wiederkehr] and may close as well as open the movement.
8. Narratio is, as it were, a report, a tale in which the meaning
and nature of the delivery is suggested.
It is found at the entrance of
the vocal part or the outstanding concertato-part
[vornehmste ConcertStimme] and is related to the preceding exordium by means of a clever
connection.
9. The propositio,
the proposition itself, briefly contains the

or compound.
Here we must mention colored or ornamented [verbramte] propositions,
which belong to music exclusively and are unknown in rhetoric.
Such propositions
have their place immediately
73. Vorwurff, Gegenstande oder Objecto.
74. Mattheson uses the word tropos.
The English cognate is
"trope" which as a rhetorical term means "a figure of speech; the use
of a word or expression in a figurative sense!'
Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary, 1950, p. 912.

following the first paragraph [Absatz] of the melody, where the bass,
as it were, takes the lead, and presents the subject [of the musical
speech]75 briefly and simply.
Thereupon the vocal part begins its

see whether it fits this outline.
That will make everything we have
said here much clearer to both eye and ear, although it may now be new
and strange.
10. Confutatio is the resolution of objections.76
In music it may
be expressed by means of ties [Bindungen] or by the citation and refutation of apparently foreign passages.
Such contrasts, carefully used,
are a special source of aural pleasure.
Everything that goes against
the proposition is resolved and settled.
This part of disposition,
although it is one of the most beautiful, is not found in music very often.
11. Confirmatio is the clever reinforcement

12. Peroratio, finally, is the end or conclusion of our musical
oration and must, above all else, be especially moving. The conclusion
is found not only in the melody itself, but most often in the postlude
whether for bass or for many voices,
and whether this
[Nachspiel],
ritornello has been heard before or not. It is customary that the aria
concludes with the same material with which it began. This, consequently, serves as peroratio as well as exordium.
13. Here, too, a clever composer can often agreeably surprise
his listeners by making unexpected changes in the close of melodies as
well as in the postludes.
They will make a very pleasant impression
and thus give rise to the special emotions that correspond to them.
That is the real purpose of the peroration.
The kind of close that
breaks off suddenly, ex abrupto, also serves as a useful means of
arousing emotions.
14. As proof of the above statements let us examine an aria
Marcello.
It will be a model according to which one can examine
other melodies with regard to their disposition,
for although not
compositions share the same sequence of [rhetorical] parts, almost
of these sections will be found in any good melody.

75. "Subject" here must be taken as a rhetorical term.
The
German word is Sache which can be understood only as the "subject" of
a speech or an essay and has no musical connotation.
76. In rhetoric confutatio means that the speaker presents arguments against his own proposition andthen proceeds to resolve them.
77. Reprise means a repetition of entire sections; repetition indicated by a sign. (Walther, op. cit., p. 521.)

15.

The following bass-subject

is the exordium of the aria:

The same is taken up without ado by the voice and, since it already reveals the entire purpose of the melody, it is used almost identically
in the following manner; however, it is now at a higher pitch:

This is actually the narration, which is continued up to a cadence,

16. After a modulation to the third79 the bass begins an answer,
the real proposition,
as it were, which appears thus as propositio
simplex:

Even though the subject is still the same, it has gained new strength
from having been transposed.
Since it is first stated by the bass alone,
it is a simple proposition.

* It seems that the composer has used the transposed

ing staves do not bear a key-signature
is added only as an accidental.
One can see that even the old modes
can still be used in the galant style.
78. The vocal part is originally in the c-soprano clef. Mattheson's vocal notation, i.e., as far as the note-flags are concerned, has
been retained.
79. Nachdem nun der Absatz in der Tertz erfolgt ist ...
Mattheson's omission of the actual part here referred to makes a translation of this passage somewhat difficult.
Whether or not there is a
modulation in the technical sense is not apparent from his text. The
translator has used the word "modulation" to indicate that the music
has somehow moved to C. The problem is not acute here, since between minor and its relative major there is no problem of modulation.
196

17. Next, however, the voice enters with a noticeable
and thus creates a propositio variata:

Next, the melody is continued in the same manner for several measures
until the meaning of the words demands a halt again.
18. Now the bass takes up the subject once more, in a way that
resembles
the beginning.
Before it has come to the end, however, it
is met by the voice-part,
which gives the melody an entirely new appearance. In company with the bass it thus forms a compound proposition, propositio composita, as follows:

with noticeable and beautiful alteration.

This is as far as the first half of the musical speech goes; it is then,
usually, closed in the same way in which it began andthus a peroration
or conclusion is made.

80. The translator has made some unindicated corrections.
The
upper voice of the original is short an eighth rest in the first measure.
There is no sharp before the g in the upper voice of the original. In the
case of the missing sharp the error obviously occurred in printing; the
lines on which the notes stood were printed with the notes, and there is
a distinct gap in the stave before the g in question.

dined will pursue this study further. He will be astonished to find that
these things are contained in all good melodies,
just as if they [the
rhetorical parts] had been made for the purpose.
24. Such disposition is very important, and the relationship between all the parts of a piece depends on it. Nevertheless,
many excellent persons and very inventive composers usually overlook it. If
it is by accident, since they
nonetheless
succeed,
they sometimes
of their natural gifts and inignore the basic rules and, regardless
stincts, have never formulated any rules concerning disposition.
25. The art of the orators consists of the following: they begin
with their strongest arguments, present the weaker ones in the middle,
and close with stronger ones again. This could well be something of
which the musician, too, may make use, particularly in the general
disposition of his work. It may seem as if this prescription lent approval to those [composers] who do nothing but give their arias a good
da capo in which, while the beginning and end are equally strong, the
middle often looks quite pathetic.
The reason why this kind of disposition is not good lies in the fact that it ignores the whole while putting
all the effort into certain parts. One must understand that a work must
not merely have this appearance in general, but be particularly disposed in such a way that each part in itself observes the three degrees
of strong, stronger, and strongest argument. 87
27. In writing large oratorios I usually begin atthe end and work
this out while the spirit is still fresh enough for me to create something
effective.
all the while I consider the rest of the work.
Nevertheless,
Everyone must follow his own inclination. If I mention my way [of composing], I do it neither out of conceit, nor in order to make it a rule,
but only to point out that I have always succeeded with this method. The
listeners have always been so moved atthe end, where it matters most,
that they remembered a great deal of it.

If we are finally forced to say something about decoration,
chiefly to remind the reader that this depends more on the
of the singer and player than on the composer.
There must,
be some decoration of melody, and the figures and ornaments
will serve well here if they are properly applied.

beauty of their original melody is often lost. In these phrase-figures
all word-figures
are lost. Since the latter are best in music where
notes take the place of words, they should come first, regardless of
all alterations and variations of phrases, i.e., of entire passages or
musical periods.
42. Printz* tells the following relevant story about the famous
Josquin: "When Josquin** was still at Cambrai, a performer added an
indecent ornament [Coloratur] in one of his works. He [Josquin] became so annoyed that he said to the performer,
'You ass, why do you
add an ornament?
If I had wanted that ornament I should have written
it. If you wish to improve well-composed
music, write your own but
leave mine alone!"
43. Nevertheless,
we do not hold ornaments in contempt. Wellplaced ornaments are to be esteemed, whether a composer who is himself a clever singer or instrumentalist
has written them in or whether
they be added by the performer. We do disapprove of their abuse, however, and of the singers and players who, lacking in taste and sense,
use them excessively,
without moderation,

rule for it; in fact, no information [Unterricht] about it has been available and the name is not found in the latest musical dictionaries.

strange discovery, namely, that music behaved like rhetoric in this reHow marvellous!

instruct others in the art, ought to be ashamed of their own backwardness.
Although one or the other of them has naturally stumbled on
some healthy thoughts, the good gentlemen have remained on the edge
without penetrating to the core of the problem.
Consequently they have
neither publicly nor privatelybeen able to putthe matter into its proper
form. 102
5. Each statement [Antrag], be it spoken or written consists of
sentences or periods.
These, in turn, consist of smaller sections that
together make up a period. Sentences made in such a way grow into
paragraphs and several paragraphs make a chapter. This, in brief, is
the stepwise design or climax of all that is spoken, written, sung, or
played.
100. Concerning distributio see footnote 86.
Mimesis.
"In rhetoric mimesis means the mocking imitation of
something previously said.
Vogt explains its musical application as
follows: 'Ethonopesis vel mimesis.
Cum aliquis alterius vocem imiThe translator interprets this as"...
tatur, ut mulieris!"
If some
voice imitates another in the manner of a woman (i.e., on a higher
pitch)!' Unger, op. cit., p. 83.
"Expolitio consists of remaining in the same place and looking at

general be translated simply as "punctuation" hereafter.

13. If many such arias and recitatives

work becomes a cantata or a scene [Auftritt], which may be considered
a musical chapter.

15. When there are several periods I can make several different
formal closes or stops by the use of different keys106 (except for the
last one). The paragraph, however, must be the only place to have a
complete final close; i. e., when the final period is also the last one.
If the last period is repeated, it has the same freedom as its predecessors. There is nothing, by the way, to keep me from making a cadence
on the tonic elsewhere than at the end. This is frequently
very good at
the beginning. 107
23. One rarely finds inexperienced or untutored composers who
jump over a comma in speech, although even the brighter ones may do
this - after due consideration - in composing.
The former make a
pause or stop all too often where [in the text] no comma can be either
heard or seen. Examples of this are so frequent that I

28. In the following example five complete joints109 may be met

34. There is, however, small comfort in this, for not every
suggested joint in writing, not to mention singing, demands a special
stop. It is therefore easy to see that one must bear in mind that not
only are there written commas that are not actually pronounced, but
also many that can and must be ignored in melody. 115 That is the
reason for this distinction, which should be well noted in Critica musica, 116 inter comma perfectum ac pendulum, i. e., between a perfect
and an imperfect joint of speech.
35. Since we have already given two examples of the perfect
comma, with as well as without rests, it appears to be appropriate now
to give a small example of the imperfect comma as well.
Let me say
in advance that the dubious or hanging comma is sometimes subjected
to only a very brief stop; most often, however, it is subjected to no
stop at all.
36. The first, that is the short stop, occurs after a sad exclamation (exclamatio) or after such a command (imperativus) as truly
demands a pause or thought. For example:
O! that Zion's help would come to Israel.
Or:
Stop!

Do not slay him.

He is the king, etc.

the second, a cadence ending on the first inversion of the tonic triad (V

116. J. Mattheson. A periodical collected in two volumes, 172225.
* It may easily be seen - and should be excused - that I make
an effort to explain grammatical as well as other terms
by means of
equivalent German ones. Unfortunately I have to consider those among
my readers who, while theyare musically learned, wouldhave difficulty

urgency of the expression.
We need not give a musical example, the words themselves suffice.
Extinguish, Cupid, your flattering light! (punctum)

Phlegeton, give me glittering sulphur!
Lend me, O stars, the face of Medusa,
(comma perf.)
That I may punish the shameful offense! (punctum)
Let me, O heavens, bask in the joy,
(comma perf.)
Of revenge!
38. Besides the four periods or sentences and the two perfect
joints, we have here seven suspended commas, namely the four inserted
vocativi, "Cupid'' "O stars,' "O heavens:' and "Phlegeton"' all of whom
are called upon.
Besides these there are three emotional words of
command or imperativi: "extinguish:' "give me:' and "let me!' None of
these seven, however are regarded as [separable] sections of melody.
We may judge similar things according to this example.
39. While the comma represents that part of speech called a
joint or articulus in the human body, the colon represents a membrum,
an entire member, as the Greek name implies.
The semicolon (;) is
Let us discuss the latter first.
The semicolon

represents a section half-way between colon and comma. Such sections
are used for disjunctivi, oppositi, and relativi, i. e., in such places as
represent a separation, an opposite, or something referring to someare contained within a
thing else, especially when such circumstances
few words.
40. The semicolon has another characteristic
peculiar to itself:
it is often used before the grammatical
meaning has been completed.
The colon, on the other hand, is never used in such a case; it requires
complete grammatical sense while the rhetorical meaning, however, is
still unresolved.
41. Disjunctiva express separation and disparity but not opposition. Thus they maybe expressed in melody by such tonal relationships
as are somewhat removed from one another. Example: "You I honored
more; him I loved more!' Or: "I must surrender my body to you; do not
demand my heart as well!' In the first sentence love and honor are
Heart
separated from one another; however, they are not opposites.
and body are separated, as it were, in the second sentence; they are
not, however, hostile to each other.
42. In such cases the melody must make a noticeable distinction;
one member of the musical rhetoric must be parted or separated from
the other in some way. However, one must not introduce something
[musical] that is opposed, whether by means of tonality or interval. 117
in saying what exclamatio, vocativi, adverbia, etc. mean. It annoys
me to have reason to add this note.
117. A concluding part of the sentence has been omitted, since
its significance,
which does not appear to be important, is somewhat
obscure.

43. The most important element in such cases depends on stress
or emphasis.
In the first example the main stresses
are on the pronouns "you" and "him"; another, if lesser,
stress falls on the verbs
"honored" and "loved!' In the second example the greatest stress is
demanded by the word "not" and a weaker one by the noun "heart!' A
formal close, as in the above examples, is not always necessary
44. When there is actual opposition, the situation is quite different. Opposition of the words demands similar opposition in the music.
Such conflicting delivery is best suited to recitatives
and arias.
It
must not be forced, however.
An example in melismatic style:
One promises with mouth and hand,
One will not say a word;
But, as soon as a back is turned,
The promise is already broken. 121
118. This paragraph becomes clearer when the musical example
in paragraph 45 is examined.
In that example Mattheson, in order to
express opposites, divides the setting into two parts corresponding to
the two parts of the sentence.
The first part ascends, the second descends.
The translator
assumes that the comment about changing
major to minor thirds refers to a case in which the music is repeated.
In that case, since the parts of the sentence are not "opposites" any
change should not be too radical.
119. You I honored more; him I loved more.
120. I must surrender my body to you; do not demand my heart
as well.
121. The translation of this poem serves also as the translation
of the text in the following musical example.
213

These are clearly opposites: to keep one's word or to break it. These
conflicting acts may be expressed by such opposite motion of tones and
intervals as will make an image for the ear.
45. I say that one may do this - not that this is a requisite so
indispensable that without it the melody ceases to be a melody. Clarity
is clarity, however.
Also, such remarks [as the above] are helpful to
invention, for opposites can be melodically expressed in several ways:
by means of passages that reverse their path, by intervals that run
counter to each other, by sudden changes of key and meter, etc. To
avoid becoming too lengthy, we shall give an example of the first kind
of contrast [only].

50. Space does not permit an examination of the similarities
between all of the above four or five half-members.
If you examine the
entire paragraph, you will find that a certain falling of the melody [Fall
der Stimme] always points up the semicolon.
The bass, too, contributes its share in marking the sections, especially
in marking a new
sentence - not by contrast, however, but by similarity.
The five
joints or commas are treated quite differently: the lowest voice does
not even approach a complete clausula. On the other hand, at the colon
or complete joint a formal close combined with rests aids further
thought, and what follows is in a different key. The question is contrasted, and at the exclamation point there is a final cadence.
51. Sometimes one finds an antithesis,
a contrast, between the
first and second parts of an aria. In that case the semicolon at the end
of the first part becomes of necessity
a period, since, when it is repeated from the beginning, it must be the final close and thus demands
a complete cadence in the tonic key [Final-Note].
Let the following
words serve as example:
Shall I love another?
My ambition says "yes";
But I shudder to see,
How it would grieve her,
Who favored me.

(da capo)

52. Aside from this single case, which I should rather avoid by
means of working the da capo out twice, 127 the semicolon must never
have a formal, certainly not a complete cadence.
One must not pay
too much attention to the poets, who often can show little reason for
their punctuation.
It is a somewhat controversial subject.
Some prefer not to use the semicolon at all and restrict themselves to commas

However it remains clear that something must follow to complete the
rhetorical meaning. For the latter reason the colon may not have a
complete final cadence, but rather one that calls for further motion, a
resting place that demands resumption, a clausula desiderans. 129

58. "Examples" may be treated in the same manner. A deduction is different and does not need a resting point that demands resumption. Similes can stand a preceding cadence; headings, however, [have

65. If one were to suppose that, as among questions there are
two kinds, so among exclamations there are three, closer examination
would prove him right. Thus the composer is obliged to make a distinction, although there is only one kind of sign (!). The first kind [of
exclamation] includes astonishment,
joyous exclamation, or an encouraging command. For example:
1.

Monarch!
Mighty one!

You are the unconquerable

Hammonia!

Joy is the master and the reigning passion here. For this reason vivid
and fast passages as well as large intervals must be used.
66. The second kind of exclamation
embraces all wishing and
heartfelt yearning; all pleading, invocation, and complaint, as well as
fear, horror, terror, etc. The last-named demand melodic violence,
which is best expressed by fast and nimble sounds. Yearning and the
other emotions are always children of sadness.
For example:
Heaven! If you still have mercy for my
suffering, then, o! now is the time to help me.

main rule that can be given is that such emphasis almost always involves a noticeable rise of the vocal part, if not necessarily
a great
one. (Even a half-step may often suffice.)
The stressed note need not
be the accented one.
12.

Let us take the following words as an example:
U ciel ti fe SI bella,
Leggiadra pastorella,
Perche tu sia PIETOSA; NON cruda
al tuo pastor. *

13. We find three points of emphasis here, on the words si,
pietosa, and non. ** Musically they might be expressed in the following
manner: (see page 225).
14. The felicity of a well-placed
accent can be no better illustrated than by a comparison with a poorly placed one. From such observation of opposites much advantage is to be gained both in learning
and in teaching. 140
16. The word-accent
must always be placed on an accented note
of the melody [melodischen.Klang].
It does not matter whether in this
case, the note is especially
raised, as for emphasis, as long as it is
not lowered too much in repetition [Wiederspiel]. 141
17. The general rule to be observed when dealing with accent is
this: the note that falls on the accent of the text] must be appropriately
2 It should be observed that emlong or newly struck [anschlagend.

phasis does not depend on this exclusively.
passing notes [durchgehende Noten] if it is provided with some other
distinguishing factor.
18. To clarify the above it is necessary to say that neither an
accent alone nor the written time value [ausserliche Geltung] can make
a note long or anschlagend in the present meaning. The inner content
* Transl.: Heaven made you so beautiful, pretty shepherdess, that
you should show pity to your shepherd, not cruelty.
** Si is an incendens which raises beautyhigher; pietosa the word
on which the whole piece depends and cruda would contradict this, were
it not for non. These are the reasons why stress falls onthese particular words, where some persons would least expect it.
140. A paragraph discussing
accentuation in speech has been
omitted.
141. The translator cannot clarify this somewhat obscure passage except for the assumption that Mattheson is referring to a repetition of the text with a different musical accompaniment.
142. "Anschlagen is the opposite of remaining on the same note
and of passing notes.
It means, especially in keyboard playing, to
strike the previous note again, or to strike a new one!' [Literallytranslated it would read "to strike the previous fingering again... "] Walther, op. cit. p. 38.
226

and melodic [singende]

accent alone can do this.

19. Of what this content and melodic accent consists has been
sufficiently explained in Critica musica on pages 40, 41, 42, and 43.143
We ask the reader to refer to it so that we need not become too lengthy
here. The whole problem may be likened to a coin whose inner and
outer values are often quite different.
20. Let us give some examples of poorly placed accents and ask
ourselves on which syllables of the word zweiffelhafft [doubtful] the accent lies and whether the following figure places it correctly.

21. Both times the syllable hafft stands out, doubly so since it
not only ascends but also has intrinsic value. 145 This can be justified
only for the first syllable. 14 Without doubt, the passage ought to read
as follows:

143. "An accent is the inner content and emphasis of a note
which takes place in such a way that at certain times a note stands out
from the others even though its appearance does not differ fromtheirs:'
Crit. mus., Vol. I, p. 43.
"Accentus and anschlagende notes are synonyms!' Ibid., p. 44.
144. "Never to doubt"' All the translations
of the texts of musical examples inthis chapter willbe quite literal in order not to obscure
Mattheson's arguments.
145. "Intrinsic value" is the literal translation.
The term presumably refers to the fact that the syllable falls on an accented part of
the measure.
146. The word zweifelhaft (the modern spelling) is accented on
the first syllable.
As far as meaning goes, too, emphasizing the last
syllable would be analogous to an emphasis on the last syllable of the
English word "doubtfull'
227

22. Thus we have seen a small example taken from a real aria.
This terrible state of affairs, however, is found more often in recitatives and we shall therefore give some examples in order, so to speak,
to contrast black and white.

23. Anyone can see that the numbers vier [four] and eins [one]
are the important words. The accent as well as the emphasis [of the
text] lies on them and not the word Theil [part]. Since this time neither
rising nor intrinsic value were made use of, and the notes were both
times short and of no particular value, we should change the passage in
the following manner:

30. While most German words of two syllables usually have their
accent on the first, the second being short or being made short, there
is one exception in musical composition.
Almost all the final notes of
a melody must be anschlagend or have the accent, although the final
syllable on which the note falls may be short.
31. I say "almost all"' i. e., almost every last note of a melody,
since I mean all real and formal cadences.
Frequently an exception is
made if one wishes to stop abruptly. In former days nobody observed
this fine point [Artigkeit] of composition and ended thus:

the syllables have no accent, however, it is, nevertheless,
possible to
have a melodic accent. This is one of the musical prerogatives.
33. We come now to passaggi.
Right here let us take the words
of Pilate from the Passion: "Weisst Du nicht, dass ich Macht habe?
etc!'153 Would it make an emphatic or pointed melody to place a
melisma of twenty-eight sixteenths on the word habe [have]? I doubt
that anyone would think so, not even the composer.
The latter would
be like David who did not believe that Nathan's story of the sheep concerned him.
34. A melisma on habe, however, would be preferable to one on
the wordKind [child] in the first stanza of an ode, in which [type] nobody
binds our hands, as here:

35. How large a field we should find before us were we to examine and index such things! It is to be hoped that intelligent composers will proceed more thoughtfully and will not write music that
takes its toll by suppressing emphasis.155
If for one reason or another
they want or must use such decorative passages with unfruitful words,
let them at least not select such clumsy ones. 156

We add
the literal translation here, "... instead of emphasis makes the music
a [means] of suppressing!'
A possibility that in this context does not
appear a likely one would mean exactly the opposite, "... instead of
emphasis suppress the music!'
156. Five paragraphs dealing with repetition are summarized
here rather than being given in full.
Repetition of words should be
used only for the sake of emphasis.
Mattheson dislikes repeating
"innocent words" and thus "submitting them to torture!' Words of importance, however "may well be repeated three or four times in order
to lend them stronger emphasis!'

Take for example the following words:
Let flow into my heart
O God, despite all pain of sin,
But one drop of Christ's blood.

The words may be declaimed and broken up in five different ways after
they have occurred once in their proper order: 1) Let flow, o God etc.;
2) But one drop into this heart; 3) Let flow Christ's blood into my
heart; 4) Despite all pain of sin into my heart; 5) O God, but one drop.
46. This figure is most effective where the meaning of the words
is somewhat far-fetched
or dislocated [verworffen] or if, as in the
above example, there are three or four phrases that must be heard in
their entirety before the whole can be grasped.
In such cases analysis
not only furthers understanding and is almost necessary,
but lends extraordinary beauty and unexpectedly moving emphasis.7

Since Mattheson, in his chapter on the various rhythms (Pt. II,
Ch. VI, Concerning the Length and Brevity of Sound or the Organization
of Sound-Feet),
offers few comments on their affects, the translator

In his earlier book, Das neu-eroffnete Orchestre,
Mattheson devotes an entire chapter (Part III, Chapter II) to the affects expressed
by the various keys. Since he omits this aspect of the doctrine of the
affects in Der vollkommene Capellmeister,
a summary of his previous
discussion is appended here. It should be pointed out that, dogmatic as
he appears to be, Mattheson is aware of the fact that there is not
and never will be any unanimity of opinion on this subject and advises
his readers that he does not wish to usurp their right to form theories of
their own. He is giving his own opinions "only in order to help the
reader to get a clearer view of the subject.'
Before going into the discussion
of the keys, he summarizes
earlier opinions on the modes very briefly.
He is apparently unaware,
however, that the Greek modes differed from the later church modes.
In describing the affects of the keys, he cites other writers such as
Athanasius Kircher,159
and Johann Michael Corvinus. 160
Glareanus,
The following summary will be restricted to the opinions of Mattheson
without consideration
of what other writers may have had to say on the
subject.
Two general opinions about the nature of the keys are rejected by
Mattheson, one in its entirety, the other as "oversimplified''
To believe that major keys are gay and minor keys sad is not entirely wrong,
says Mattheson; it is just not as simple as that. But it is stupid to believe that keys that have a signature with flats are "soft and tender:'
while the keys with sharps are "hard, fresh, and gay'' He further warns
the reader that he is going to base the descriptions that are about to
follow on Cammer-Ton,
not Chor-Ton.161
The order in which Mattheson lists the keys has been retained in our summary.
D minor, the tono primo (Dorian) is believed by Mattheson to be
somewhat devout and calm, at the same time grand, agreeable, and exHe therefore recommends it for the furtherpressive of contentment.
