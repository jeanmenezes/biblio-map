In this paper, we study the ﬁrst movement of Brahms’ op. 51 nr. 1 in two musical dimensions. On the one
hand, we investigate tonal trends and tonal extremes. On the other, we study the positions of Forte’s (and
Huron’s) α-motif in relation to the musical form. We ﬁnd that α-motives are especially prevalent in the
development section. We also combine these two musical dimensions to see whether the α-motives have
some relation to tonal trends. They proved to occur more prominently in remote tonal regions than in those
near the main tonality.
Keywords: comparison structure analysis; tonal distance; motivic analysis; tonal principal component

1. Introduction
The aim of this article is to propose a computational study of the ﬁrst movement of Brahms’ String
Quartet op. 51 nr. 1 in relation to two analytical aspects. We investigate the tonal evolution in the
piece. Instead of focusing on key identiﬁcations that is often the aim in computer-assisted tonal
analyses [1,2], the purpose of what we call comparison structure analysis (CSA) [3] is to ﬁnd
(i) tonal trends (or tonal stability) according to some reference pitch-class (pc) set and (ii) tonal
extremes, i.e. musical segments that represent tonally the farthest points in the composition as
far as their tonal stability values, compared with all musical segments, are concerned. We also
study, statistically, the positions of Forte’s and (Huron’s) α-motif in relation to musical form and
tonality (based on our CSA).
The aim of our automated approach to tonality analysis is ﬁrst and foremost practical: to
produce visual representations of dynamic musical properties by evaluating the prevalence of a
chosen musical data structure evolving through a musical piece. CSA uses concepts and techniques drawn from traditional music analysis and music information retrieval (MIR). Theoretically
deﬁned musical entities, such as set classes, pc sets or particular rhythm patterns are detected in
compositions using pattern extraction and pattern comparison algorithms that are typical within
the ﬁeld of MIR. Our CSA approach can be applied to monophonic as well as polyphonic music.

In CSA, continuous musical data are automatically segmented into segments of the same cardinality and thereafter these segments are compared against a comparison structure (CS) using a
similarity function in relation to a speciﬁc music dimension. In other words, the latter procedure
measures, according to the selected music dimension, the prevalence of the CS at each point
of the composition. Since the musical dimension under investigation is tonality, we consider pc
information of the piece. Such tonality-based analyses with CSA have been demonstrated in [3,4].
The data consist of pc that are clustered into (non-ordered) pc segments, representing pc sets of
equal cardinality.
Since 1982, when Krumhansl and Kessler [5] introduced their probe tone weightings for major
and minor key proﬁles, researchers in the ﬁeld have presented several successful applications
for tonal analysis (e.g. Krumhansl–Schmuckler’s [6] algorithm and Sapp’s [2] application). In a
way, our proposed CSA resembles their approaches that involve a key ﬁnding using key proﬁles
and correlation. Technically speaking, their key proﬁles can be paralleled to our concept of CS.
However, our approach is more ﬂexible, since the CS can be any possible representative of all pc
sets, except from the empty set and the total chroma (not to mention the CS of dimensions other
than tonality; more examples of the usage of CSA can be found in [7,8]), whereas the key proﬁles
are ﬁxed.1
The analysis procedure occurs in multiple phases and produces as its end product a (discrete)
curve, called the tonality CSA curve according to the selected CS, that describes how tonality
evolves away from CS within the analysed piece. Since other dimensions of music such as rhythm
and melody could be treated as well using CSA, it would have been possible to compare different
musical dimensions, for example, by measuring the correlation between these different CSA
curves. However, due to the focus of the present Special Issue, we decided in this study to consider
instead the occurrences of Forte’s [9] α-motif according to their placement in the musical form
and in their tonal environment with the resulting tonality CSA curve by using various appropriate
statistical tools.

CSA for tonal analysis

CSA consists of two main parts. First the segmentation procedure yields pc sets of a ﬁxed cardinality extracted from the piece, called pc segments. The second part consists of the comparison
procedures in which all pc segments are compared, using a tonal similarity distance function, ﬁrst
with the so-called CS, a selected pc set, second with each other. For ﬁnding the CS, we use the
principal component analysis (PCA) for all pc segments.
2.1. Segmentation procedures
CSA depends on an automatic ﬁxed-length segmentation that allows for a statistical or mathematical survey of the data. The problem is that there are, in theory, a combinatorial number of
possible segmentations. For example, Hasty [10] has shown that multiple segmentations of the
same material may be meaningfully developed from different perspectives. In the present analysis,
we apply a segmentation method which aims at creating unordered pc set clusters, presented in
[3]. The idea in the clustering segmentation is to associate at least one pc set of a selected ﬁxed
segmentation cardinality nseg with each unique note onset time by collecting (i.e. clustering) the
most proximate pc from its nearest environment. We denote each onset time as un , where b refers
b
to a bar number and n refers to an order number of the onset time in the bar. We associate each
n
onset time un with a cluster of k pc segments, the latter being denoted as sb k , where k = 1, 2, . . ..
b
For example, if nseg = 5 and there are two different note onset times in a bar, the segmentation

procedure produces at least two pentachords (i.e. two pc segments) associated with that bar as a
chord description of its pitch environment (see Table 1 for examples of pc segments). The segmentation algorithm, which produces often – but not always – overlapping segments, proceeds
with the following rules:
(1) For each onset time, aim at deﬁning an associated segment or segments of the selected
cardinality.
(2) Vertical groupings are preferable.
(3) If the number of pc at the onset exceeds the selected cardinality, assign all possible pc
combinations to the onset.2
(4) It is preferable to add missing pc from the onsets that are closest temporally.
(5) If there are equally close alternatives before and after the onset, it is preferable to search for
them systematically either from one or the other direction, but not from both directions, in
order to diminish evolving ‘noise’ from the resulting data. For this analysis, we preferred
searching for the missing pc ﬁrst before an onset.
(6) To be even-handed, several alternatives of equal value may have to be assigned to the same
onset.
In order to illustrate the segmentation method, pentachordal segments for bar 147 of Brahms’
quartet movement are represented in Table 1, cf. note example in Figure 1. The chord in the ﬁrst
note onset time u1 consists of pc 1, 4, 6 and 10. Thus, we need one more pc to complete the

cardinality. We ﬁnd the nearest neighbour notes in the next onset, which includes two alternative
11
add-on pc: 2 and 11. Therefore, we get for u1 two pc segments: s147 = {1, 2, 4, 6, 10} and
147
12
2
s147 = {1, 4, 6, 10, 11}. The procedure is similar for u147 , which inherits the two missing pc from
the nearest neighbour chord, that of u1 , resulting in a cluster of three pc segments.
147
The distance at which we gather the required pc – for fulﬁlling the segmentation cardinality –
varies depending on the number of pc at the note onset itself and the pc density of the musical
texture. Our aim is to assign averaged tonal distance values – associated with pc segments – to
note onsets (for details, see Section 2.3). Therefore, we want to ensure that we do not collect the
required pc too far from the pivotal note onset time by using a too large segmentation cardinality.
For that reason, we ﬁrst evaluate in the whole score the average pc cardinality nbar over score
¯
bars and select the integer value nbar for the segmentation cardinality. It is then possible to
¯
check the average ‘width’ of the neighbourhoods covered by the constructed pc segments with the
selected segmentation cardinality. Thereafter, we may decide to use a still smaller segmentation
cardinality for the tonal analysis in order to ensure that the calculated averaged tonal distance
values really function as tonal descriptions of the location in the composition to which they are
indexed [3,7]. At the same time, we have to look out for the cardinality of the selected CS: the
bigger the cardinality difference between the cardinality of the CS and the cardinality of segments,
the lower the separating capacity of the measurements. What is even more important is to keep
the cardinality of all pc segments the same: it can be shown that if the cardinality of pc segments
varies, the procedure results in mutually arbitrary segment distance values [3, p. 28]. However,
since all segments are of the same cardinality, the resulting values still remain commensurate. As
was shown by using the so-called sensitivity analysis, CSA is quite a robust method as far as there
is enough data available [3].

2.2. Selection of the CS
All pc segments are to be compared with a reference structure, the so-called CS. Since tonality is
the music dimension under investigation in this paper, the CS is represented as a pc set in order to
enable using, with pc segments, a tonality similarity function in the next section. In theory, any pc
set could be selected for the comparison. But since we aim at somehow describing the evolution
of the tonality of the analysed piece, a natural choice for CS is to take the diatonic scale related
to the key signature in the tonal context (in the case of minor key, possibly the harmonic minor
scale), since, intuitively speaking, it represents best the assumed main tonality. We have taken this
approach in previous analyses [3,4]. However, it is possible that the tonalities of the piece are,
for the most part, unrelated to the key signature. In order to attempt to extract the CS from the
analysed music piece, we propose to assume that the tonality is reﬂected in pc segments as a whole
collection. For that, we use the information included in pc segments and no other information.
We thus decide to apply PCA, a simple, non-parametric method that aims at extracting relevant
information from large and complicated data sets by reducing it to a lower dimensional space
spanned by a few eigenvectors ‘in a way that best explains the variance in the data’ [11]. Thus, in
our analysis, we reduce the information from a large number of pc segments.
In PCA, the desired CS would be determined by calculating the ﬁrst principal component (PC)
for all the pc segments. PCA has been applied in different tasks in the MIR system (e.g. [12, pp.
103, 362]), and to computational music analysis, as well. Purwins et al. [13] used correspondence
analysis (a similar method to PCA) in order to visualize the relation between keys and pc.
We brieﬂy summarize the calculations to determine the ﬁrst PC, i.e. the approximation of the
desired CS: we convert all the pc segments s into 12-dimensional binary vectors sbin ∈ Z12 . For
2
¯
example, s = {0, 2, 3, 6, 7} is represented as sbin = (1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0). Let sbin be the
mean 12-dimensional vector of all pc segments in their binary forms, and set sbin = sbin − sbin .
ˆ
¯

Let then B be a 12 × n matrix, in which columns are all sbin . The ﬁrst PC is the eigenvector v (of
ˆ
¯
norm 1) of BBT corresponding to the largest eigenvalue. It is a 12-dimensional vector in R12 , and
its components – that are most commonly solved numerically by the computer – are most likely
not integers. Thus, it does not represent any pc set and does not directly correspond to any actual
musical entity. However, it can be seen as a kind of mathematical condensation of the tonalities
of the piece representing the maximum variance with all the pc segments. In other words, its pc
set approximation could be considered as the closest pc set structure that most stabilizes all pc
segments for the analysis. For testing the procedure in another context, PCA was applied to the
ﬁrst 100 of Bach’s 371 chorales (the segmentation cardinality being 4) and thereafter the PCs
were compared with 24 KK key proﬁles [6] using the Pearson correlation coefﬁcient. As a result,
approximately 68 keys were able to be deﬁned correctly, in 22 cases the procedure proposed the
dominant key (I->V or i->v) and in 10 cases some other alternative key. In this study, the ﬁrst PC
proves to bring us back to our natural choice in deﬁning the CS: as will be seen in Section 5, the CS
turns out to give support to the theoretical tonality denoted by the key signature of the movement.

2.3. Tonal distance
In the next phase, we compare all pc segments s with CS using Parncutt’s model that predicts the
perceptual root(s) of a pc set together with the correlation distances [14].3 In Parncutt’s model,
the tonality proﬁle of a pc set p is introduced as
W (p) = (pbin · σ 0 (w), . . . , pbin · σ 11 (w)),
where pbin is the binary 12-dimensional vector representation of p, w is a vector of ‘rootsupport weights’ and σ i indicates a cyclic permutation of w. In this study, we set the
root-support vector w as (0.144, 0.052, 0.106, 0.095, 0.094, 0.125, 0.043, 0.129, 0.033,
0.037, 0.036, 0.106). These are not the original weights that Parncutt [14] proposes.
Instead, the weights have been ‘tuned’ anew by applying the so-called constraint satisfaction problem in the Monte Carlo process as presented in [4, Chapter 2.1]. Thus, σ 1 (w) =
(0.106, 0.144, 0.052, 0.106, 0.095, 0.094, 0.125, 0.043, 0.129, 0.033, 0.037, 0.036), etc. The
resulting vector W (p) forms a series of pc weights in relation to p for which the higher the value the
more probably the associated pc represents the tonal centre of p. For example, for the C major triad,
its binary vector representation is (1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0), and we obtain W (Cmajor triad) =
(0.367, 0.244, 0.267, 0.183, 0.272, 0.341, 0.131, 0.306, 0.233, 0.260, 0.186, 0.210). Thus, the
best candidate for the root pc of the C major triad is pc 0.
In order to calculate a tonal distance d between two pc sets p1 and p2 , we set
d(p1 , p2 ) = 1 − corr(W (p1 ), W (p2 )),
where corr stands for the Pearson correlation coefﬁcient between the two tonality proﬁles W (p1 )
and W (p2 ) [4]. While correlation values are between −1 and 1, and where 1 indicates a perfect
positive linear relationship, the distance values between two pc sets are between 0 and 2. We thus
decide to normalize the later values at a range of 0 to 1.
In our CSA, we are interested in calculating the tonal distance between all pc segments si (p1 )
and the selected CS (p2 ). To each note onset un , we assign the mean of all the tonal distance
b
n
n
values d(sb k , CS) for pc segments sb k assigned to the onset un . This results in what we call the
b
(linear interpolated) tonality CSA curve according to CS for which the horizontal axis is indexed
by music onsets. The closer to 0 the value at an onset is, the closer the average tonality of the
onset is to the selected CS. Thus, the CSA curve aims at representing the tonal distances from the
CS and offering, as such, illustrative information about the form of the piece. Our tonality CSA

98

approach could be comparable to a simple instance of a Riemann logic in the sense of Noll and
Garbers [15] in which CSA curves would be the associated sequence of 1 × 1-Riemann matrices,
but which values would come from a scalar product instead of the Pearson correlation coefﬁcient.

2.4. Relative tonal distance
In order to determine the ‘extreme’ tonalities of the piece, we compare pc segments among them.
For each pc segment s, we calculate its tonal distance d(s, si ) to all pc segments si in the piece.
Similarly to the former section, we calculate the mean of average tonal distances of all pc segments
s found at a given onset. We normalize these values at a range of 0 to 1. We call the resulting
averaged (linear interpolation) construct the ‘relative CSA curve’ (i.e. for which the coordinates
correspond to average distance values, between all pc segments, per onset). The closer to 0 the
value at a given onset is, the closer the average tonality of the onset is to the average tonality of the
piece. This curve aims at determining the most tonally extreme places of the piece. While such
an approach may at least be mathematically interesting, there is no evidence that these somehow
emerge perceptually from their immediate tonal context. Some empirical investigations could
lead to partially address this issue, but this is beyond the scope of this paper.
If the ﬁrst PC resulting from PCA (Section 2.2) is used to approximate the selected CS for the
analysis (as it will turn out for the Brahms’ quartet analysis – see Section 5), it is expected that
both, the CSA curve according to CS and the relative CSA curve, resemble each other since the
CS would then result from another kind of the averaging calculation among all pc segments.
3. The α-motif in the present study
Forte’s original version of α-motif can be deﬁned with a pitch-interval representation: (+2, +1)
and all its transpositions and contrapuntal transformations, i.e. (−2, −1), (+1, +2) and (−1, −2).
Huron’s α-motif can be deﬁned using a duration and pitch-interval representation: ((long,0),
(short,+2), (long,+1)) with all transpositions and contrapuntal transformations. Thus, Huron’s
α-motif’s rhythmic properties are quite broadly deﬁned for computer-assisted analysis. For our
study, we use another representation of the α-motif by taking some of Huron’s further suggestions
into consideration.
While considering his own deﬁnition of the α-motif, Huron suggests that ‘a better rhythmic
feature might arise from characterizing the precise durational proportions (e.g. the 3:1 ratio of
the dotted rhythm)’ [16, par. 57]. Huron also mentions that there is no reason for not including
the diatonically justiﬁed pattern ±(2, 2) which occurs as a major variant of the original ±(2, 1)
pattern. As far as the intervallic properties of the α-motif are concerned, Huron follows Forte’s
convention but mentions that ‘at the time of Forte’s writing, the vocabulary of the set theory was
unable to accommodate diatonic intervals, and so the (+2, +2) interval pattern was deﬁned as
a separate motive’ [16, par. 50]. Thus in this study, we do not distinguish the otherwise similar
melodic α-motifs, for example, in consecutive bars 235–236 (Figure 2).4 However, it is more
difﬁcult to say whether the temporally immediate derivatives of α-motif in bar 124 (the chromatic
(1, 1) variants) should also be taken into consideration.
Even though Huron is able to show that the rhythmic properties of α-motif are important in
deﬁning its signiﬁcance among motives, the question considering the selection of the motives
still remains: which of the variants are selected and which are not? Buteau and Mazzola have
shown that the number of motif variants can be restricted mathematically by using a motivic
similarity function and a suitable similarity threshold value [17]. However, in the present study, we
consider the intuitive selection of motif variants in a quite straightforward manner. We deﬁne our
α-motif using an inter-onset interval and pitch-interval representation: ((3/8, +2), (1/8, +1)), and

Figure 2. Two motives in bars 235–236, marked in the note example, are both seen as instances of the α-motif according
to the author’s deﬁnition.

((3/8, −2), (1/8, −1)), ((3/8, +1), (1/8, +2)), ((3/8, −1), (1/8, −2)), ((3/8, +2), (1/8, +2)),
((3/8, −2), (1/8, −2)), where 3/8 is a dotted quarter note duration and 1/8 is an eighth note
duration. So, the occurrences of α-motif, for example, in bars 232–236 are taken into account.
Thus, in our version of α-motif for the present analysis, we emphasize the rhythmic long–short
contour between the ﬁrst two notes (Figure 3).
3.1. Testing the α-motif using the tonality CSA curve
Important themes of a sonata movement (and the motives they are built of) appear in their tonal
environment and have, in this respect, a relation to tonality. Tonal elaborations, for their part, are
mostly concentrated in the development section. As Schönberg formulates it, referring to themes
in the development section of the sonata form, ‘themes of the ﬁrst division [exposition] and their
derivatives are found in a constant modulatory movement through many and even through remote
regions’ [18, p. 145]. He further explains the nature of the themes in the development section by
mentioning that ‘the elaboration normally makes use of variants of previously “exposed” themes,
seldom evolving musical ideas’ [19, p. 206]. In other words, when a sonata composer of the tonal
era enriches music with tonal elaborations, the process may be ‘balanced’ by adhering mostly to
the themes and their derivatives introduced earlier. Although this kind of generalization is justly
open to criticism [20, pp. 30, 38, 50], we may rephrase the overall idea saying that the motives that
are seen as important building units in the piece, are probably stressed in special tonal regions.
As there are no comparable studies for reference concerning the mathematical relation between
these two musical dimensions, we propose to simply compare the tonal regions of all occurrences
of the α-motif versus those of other three-note motives. This may lead us to gain some supporting
evidence of its special role in the piece.
We propose to test whether the α-motif occurs in signiﬁcantly tonally distant regions. This
proposed statistical analysis with the α-motif using the resulting CSA curve according to the

100

A. Tenkanen

selected CS goes as follows: calculate the mean μ of the CSA curve values for a reference and
the mean x of the values associated with the occurrences of the α-motif. The latter is performed
¯
with all three variants of α-motif, i.e. Forte’s, Huron’s and the one proposed by the author. By
comparing the sample means and the mean of all distance values, we see whether the sample
distribution is greater, as is assumed, than the mean of the population. A one-sample t-test is
performed to test whether each sample mean is signiﬁcantly greater than the reference mean (H0 :
mu∗ ≤ mu; level of signiﬁcance p = 0.05).5 This approach could beneﬁt from comparing it to
similar tests with different compositions, thus using a kind of an ‘anticorpus’, as Conklin [21]
calls such a control data. In short of such data, we derive all three-note motives (with inter-onset
and pitch-interval representations) from the piece and see how the α-motif compares with them.

The main components of the analytical procedure and its implementation follow the structure
illustrated in Figure 4. All algorithms are implemented in R, a language and environment for

statistical computing and graphics [22]. Thus, our implementation uses standard functionalities
from R, such as for PCA and the t-test.
The original music ﬁle is in MIDI format that is entered as a comma-separated values ﬁle
into R. Depending on the selected musical dimension for the analysis, music elements from the
score are reduced and/or transformed. In the present analysis, the dimension is tonality, thus
the notes’ pitch information is reduced to pc. The average number nb of pc in bars is calculated
¯
¯
and yields the proposed segmentation cardinality nseg = nb . Note, however, that the analyst
may change the segmentation cardinality, if wished. The clustering segmentation results in all
pc segments of cardinality nseg for the analysis. It follows the selection of the CS. In this study,
the CS is determined by the use of PCA, but it could directly be provided by the analyst. The
chosen CS is compared with all the pc segments by calculating their tonal distances. This yields
the resulting discrete tonality CSA curve according to the CS. In addition, tonal distance measures
between all pairs of pc segments are calculated yielding the relative CSA curve. Note that for
visual representation purposes (automatically carried out by the implementation), we may decide
to average per bar values from both CSA curves since the number of different onsets, which would
result in a sharp-edged curve, is rather large. Finally, for the speciﬁc purpose of this study, we
extend our CSA approach and perform statistical tests with the α-motif related to their associated
tonal regions.

5. Measurements and analytical ﬁndings
We present an elementary analysis of the ﬁrst movement of Brahms’ op. 51 nr. 1 String Quartet by
using our computational method. There are altogether 2418 different onset times in 260 bars. The
average number of pc per bar is nbar = 5.196, thus nseg = 5 is tentatively selected. The maximum
¯
number of different pc in a bar is 11 and happens only once, in the development, bar 124 (pc 10 is
missing). Segmenting all the pc to pentachordal pc clusters produces 3315 pc segments altogether.
Their mean segment width in quarter notes is 4.08, remembering that bars 1–223 consist of even
six quarter notes and bars 224–260 of four quarter notes. Thus, we decided to keep nseg = 5,
since in fact, 83% of the bars, the segment widths are smaller than the bar widths. The latter is
highlighted in the CSA curve (see Figure 5(a) and (b)) as a bolder line, whereas for the remaining
bars where the pc cardinality exceeds 4, the curve is represented with dots.
The ﬁrst PC of the 3315 pentachordal pc segments is calculated and yields
(0.54, −0.42, 0.10, 0.23, −0.23, 0.12, −0.42, 0.27, 0.21, −0.24, −0.22, 0.05). It is illustrated in
Figure 6. The pc that have greater values are in order: 0, 7, 3, 8, 5, 2, 11, 10, 4, 9, 1 and 6, and it
results in the tentatively selecting CS = {0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 11} as the tonality comparative structure
when strictly using positive values from the ﬁrst PC. In fact, it seems to emphasize the harmonic
C minor scale, the key signature of the piece, and we decide to keep this selected CS for the
analysis. We emphasize that this is a surprisingly positive result which is not self-evident in the
light of much shorter and tonally simpler Bach chorales, where the right key was predicted only
approximately in 70% of the cases. It should be mentioned that in our analysis, the CS is of
different cardinality than the segments. This is not the most optimal situation, since we cannot
ﬁnd an exact match and thus, all the resulting distance values are strictly positive. At the same
time, this means that the separating capacity is slightly diminished, since lower the segmentation
cardinality compared with the cardinality of CS, the more probable there are different subsets that
may produce the same distance value.
The resulting tonality CSA curve according to CS = {0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 11}, averaged per music
bar for visualization purposes, is illustrated in Figure 5(a). According to the curve, the music
stays near the C minor tonality only shortly in all four main sections (Exposition, Development,
Recapitulation and Coda). The curve attains the lowest values – the nearest tonal areas compared

with the C minor tonality – on bars 109–110, 150, 183, 176–178, 238 and 242, the maximum
being found in the development section, others found in recapitulation or coda.6 The highest
values are reached at the end of the development section in bars 121, 112–114, 147, 106, 149,
and most constantly in bars 128–131, where the music reaches the A major region (‘the main
tonality of the development’ and ‘the climax of the development’ [9, p. 497, 499]), a tritone
apart from Eb major, a relative key of C minor. The most salient features we observe are the
ascending trends found in the exposition and development. This is the most classic example of
Durchführung [18], but what is perhaps more striking is the sudden return from the remotest
tonalities back to the C minor region. The music in the recapitulation and the coda moves closer
to the C minor tonality than in the exposition and development. This may strengthen the sense of
asserting the basic tonality, which is only weakly present in the previous sections. The function

of such a phenomenon might be comparable to the resolution of the dissonance, but in a much
larger scale [20, p. 26].
We investigate the internally ‘extreme’ tonalities by calculating the relative tonal CSA curve.
This curve, seen in Figure 5(b), remarkably resembles that of the CSA curve in Figure 5(a). This
is due to the fact that the music is intertwined around the C minor tonality, as was shown by the
PCA. The most extraordinary tonalities are found in bars 118–120 (F minor), 147 (B minor),
106 (V of B minor) and 124 (D major): three of them are part of the exposition. The most extreme
tonality represents F minor and B minor, i.e. the farthermost tonalities in the circle of ﬁfths
compared with C minor.
Table 2 summarizes the total number of α-motif instances found in all four main sections of
the movement and Figure 5(a) illustrates their distribution in the piece together with the CSA
curve according to the harmonic C minor scale. We mark the locations of α-motif in Figure 5(a)
with vertical solid lines. Independent of the deﬁnition of the α-motif, its occurrence density per
bar is greatest in the development section (Forte, 1.20; Huron, 0.49 ; author, 0.69). This can be
intuitively seen in Figure 5(a).
In order to test whether the α-motif occurs in tonally ‘more distant regions’, we calculated
the mean μ=0.417 of all values of the CSA curve, and the mean x of values associated with
¯
α-motif according to its three different representations as presented in Section 3.1: 0.439 (Forte),
0.446 (Huron) and 0.463 (author). All these means are greater than μ thus hinting towards the
fact that the α-motif may occur in more distant regions. The t-tests are performed with each of
the three sample means x. All three versions of the α-motif seem to occur signiﬁcantly in more
¯
distant regions (Forte: t = 3.20, df = 1459, p = 0.0007; Huron: t = 1.99, df = 268, p = 0.024;
author: t = 3.41, df = 338, p = 0.0004). This statistical result is independent of the segmentation
cardinality.7 We further investigated the sample means of the CSA curve values associated with
the three different representations of α-motif by the use of Monte Carlo simulations8 [23] of the
sampling distribution (for sample size matching the α-motif sample under investigation) of all
the CSA curve values. The results that support the results produced by the t-test are illustrated in
Figure 7(a)–(c) (see the three histograms from the left).
We also confronted our results about the α-motif to similar statistical investigations on 996
different three-note motives found in the piece (with our inter-onset and pitch-interval representation, in which the four contrapuntal interval combinations are seen as the same motif). Among
them, only six motives are as or more common than our α-motif (their number of occurrence
being ≥ 67). Only two of them, ((1/8, 0), (1/8, ±1)) and ((1/8, 0), (1/8, ±2)), show statistical
signiﬁcance (p < 0.05) when compared with the CSA curve, the most common (297 occurrences) being the motif with the pitch-interval pattern (0,1) (e.g. C-C-B) produces the mean
0.0001); see Figure 7(d) (histogram from
distance value of 0.641 (t = 40.62, df = 1309, p
the right) for the Monte Carlo simulation. This chromatic motif, a derivative of α (cf. [9, p. 480])
that Forte calls λ, occurs in rowing modulations (see, for instance, bars 115–131 in the score).
It should be noted that these (0,1) motives include overlapping occurrences of its contrapuntal
versions.

Finally, according to our computational approach, we agree with both Huron and Forte
[9, p. 475; 16, par. 67] that the α-motif belongs to the candidates of the most salient features
of the work.

6. Conclusions
In this study, we applied our CSA approach to the study of tonality. Our main focus was on tonal
trends and tonal extremes in the Brahms string quartet movement which had been, for analytical
purposes, segmented into pentachordal pc segment clusters. We calculated the ﬁrst PC for these
pc segments that revealed the music piece to be – mathematically – twined around the C minor
tonality. According to the CSA, tonal elaborations seem to be organized almost systematically in
the exposition and especially in the development section, in which the tonality obtains the remotest
point, just before the recapitulation section. In this case, our CSA approach supports the expected
tonal evolution in the sonata movement [18,20]. However, we hope that further investigations with

our CSA approach may interestingly lead to compositions that do not follow tonal elaborations
that are common in classical sonata movements.
When all pairs of pc segments were compared, we found the occurrences of the most extreme
tonalities that proved to be F minor or B minor. It is, however, improbable that these mathematically calculated occurrences can somehow be observed perceptually. We could instead measure
the modulation strengths between the consecutive onsets or the bars applying the same distance
function, since modulations might be more easily recognizable.
We also studied the occurrences of α-motif and found that it occurred especially in the development section independent of its three representations (Forte’s, Huron’s and the author’s) presented
in the current study. It was also discovered that the α-motif occurs in signiﬁcantly more remote
tonal regions, according to the reference tonal structure, the harmonic C minor scale. In comparison with many alternative motives found in the piece, the α-motif belongs to the most prevalent
and to those that are more common in more remote tonal regions. These ﬁndings give support
both to Forte’s and Huron’s concept that the α-motif plays an important role in the ﬁrst movement
of Brahms’ String Quartet op. 51 nr. 1.
The validity of the segmentation cardinality is connected both to the cardinality of the CS
and especially to the properties of the musical texture itself. The complicated issue, how the
difference between the segmentation cardinality and the cardinality of CS effects results, would
need a thoroughgoing study in the future.

Later, Aarden and Temperley proposed improvements to the original Krumhansl-Kessler (KK) key proﬁles by
deriving their weights straight from the music itself [24,25].
If the vertical harmony consists of six pc and the segmentation cardinality nseg has been deﬁned as 5, we get
6 different pc sets for that particular note onset time. The number of combinations is the binomial coefﬁcient
n
k = n!/k!(n − k)!, where n is the number of objects from which you can choose and k is a number to be chosen.
The version of the model used in this study is found in [4].
In this study, the bar numbering of the movement follows the score in [26].
It is assumed that with our sample sizes the mean is normally distributed.
In this study, we deﬁne these sections as encompassing the following bars: Exposition 1–81, Development 82–132,
Recapitulation 133–223 and Coda 224–260.
Similar hypothesis tests were performed for segmentation cardinalities from 3 to 7, which led to small p-values,
except for Forte’s α-motif and segmentation cardinalities 6 and 7.
