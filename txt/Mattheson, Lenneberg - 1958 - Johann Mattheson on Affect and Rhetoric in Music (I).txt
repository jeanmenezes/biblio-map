as they are called, seems to offer to the translator the
commonplaces,

and for a statement in the preface to this work in which he says that
these compositions are meant to demonstrate - among other things not only how one can obtain good musical ideas (Inventionen) but also
how to carry them through.

of the opinions of the various writers of the eighteenth century regarding specific affective devices.

Sometimes,
where Mattheson's verbosity obscures his meaning, it has been necessary to take certain liberties; these, however, have always been indicated by the inclusion of the original word or phrase in brackets or
by an appropriate footnote.
The employment of the term "affect" instead of "affection" has a
precedent in William J. Mitchell's translation of C. P.E. Bach's Versuch iber die wahre Art das Klavier zu spielen (1759), although English
dictionaries regard as obsolete the use of this word as a noun meaning

Whenever words or phrases from the original have been quoted, Mattheson's spelling has been retained.
A word should be said about the title of the entire work which is
referred to by the translator in the original German. In modern German
the word Kapellmeister,
which literally means "orchestra master, is
used in the sense of "orchestra-" or "band-director" but only with reference to the leader of a dance or marching band. In Mattheson's time,
the concept of "conductor" in the modern sense did not yet exist, and
the term Kapellmeister
appears to have meant "director of music''
Mattheson must be using it somewhat euphemistically,
since no director
of music would have needed much of the instruction contained in this
work which, besides dealing with styles,
also
affects, and rhetoric,
explains elementary harmony, part-writing,
rhythm, etc., all subjects
of which a moderately competent music director should already have
knowledge.
Bearing this in mind, the writer, if he were to adopt a
translation of the title at all, would maintain the spirit of the original
by rendering it as The Complete Music Director although The Complete Musician might be more literally appropriate.
In making an extract, suitable for publication in a periodical,
from what was originally a master's thesis at New York University
(Graduate School of Arts and Science) the translator has had to omit

gives a somewhat onesided view of the work of the versatile Mattheson
- he was a composer, church-musician,
holder of a diplomatic post,
literary man and translator1 - it is to be hoped that the reader will
bear in mind that he is reading only excerpts from the writings of a
clever and learned man.

Concerning Sound and the Natural Science of Music
(Selections from Part I, Chapter III)
49. The fifth part of the science of sound2 which, since physical
weakness is often caused bythe states of emotion, has much in common
with the preceding one, is the most outstanding and important of all.
This part examines the effects of well-disposed
sounds on the emotions
and the soul.
50. This, as is readily seen, is material that is as far-reaching
as it is useful.
To the musical practitioner it is of more importance
than to the theoretician,
despite its primary concern with [theoretical]
observation.
51. Of much assistance here is the doctrine of the temperaments
and emotions, concerning which Descartes*
is particularly worthy of

make a distinction between the minds of the listeners
and the sounding
forces that have an effect on them.
52. What the passions are, how many there are, how they may
be moved, whether they should be eliminated or admitted and cultivated,
appear to be qaestions belonging to the field of the philosopher rather
than the musician. The latter must know, however, that the sentiments
are the true material of virtue, and that virtue is nought but a wellordered and wisely moderate sentiment.
53. Where there is no passion or affect, there is no virtue. When
our passions are ill they must be healed, not murdered.
54. It is true, nevertheless,
that those affects which are our
strongest ones, are not the best and should be clipped or held by the

in order to represent virtue and evil withhis music and to arouse inthe
listener love forthe former and hatred for the latter. For it is the true
purpose of music to be, above all else, a moral lesson
[Zucht-Lehre].
55. Those who are learned in the natural sciences know physically, as it were, how our emotions function. It would be advantageous
to the composer to have a little knowledge of this subject.

2. The first three points discussed in the preceding paragraphs
of this chapter deal somewhat briefly and naively with the nature of
sound, the nature of "sounding bodies'
and
vibrations,
sympathetic
overtones. ("Each musically useful sound already contains its harmony,
and one can usually hear its octave and fifth.') The fourth point is a
discussion of the healing power of music.

easy to see that the narrowest intervals are the most suitable.
58. Love is a diffusion of the spirits.
Thus, to express this
passion in composing, it is best to use intervals of that nature (intervallis n. diffusis et luxuriantibus).
59. Hope is an elevation of the spirit; despair, on the other hand,
a casting down [Niedersturtz]
of the same.
These are subjects that
can well be represented by sound especially when other circumstances
(tempo in particular)3 contribute their share. In such a manner one
can form a concrete picture of all the emotions and try to compose accordingly.
60. To bring in all the emotions would result in longwindedness
and we shall touch on only the most important ones. Since love is so
prevalent in music, it is reasonable to place it before all the other
emotions.
61. Much depends, in this respect, on the composer who must
make careful distinctions
between the degrees and kinds of love he
wishes to or ought to express.
The diffusion of the spirit that causes
the sentiment can happen in a variety of ways and one cannot possibly
treat all kinds of love similarly.
3. Zeitmaasse has been translated as "tempo!' The term, which
Mattheson uses interchangeably
with the noun "Rhythmicl' is defined in
Pt. II, Ch. VII, as a measuring and ordering of time and motion in music. According to this definition it appears to mean "meter!' Nevertheless, the term has been translated as "tempo" since it had that meaning

beat, and the latter by such adjectives as affettuoso, con discrezione,
col spirito, etc. ... The difference between these kinds may be roughly
suggestedby slow and fast; there are, however, much finer distinctions"'
This is probably the best place to insert Mattheson's few remarks
on the affects expressed by such Italian adjectives as the above. "In

the former looks to the future and, as a rule, is intrinsically more violent and impatient.
All yearning, all desire, all wishing and wanting,
whether moderate or the contrary, belong here. One must invent and
arrange one's music according to the manifold character of desire, as
well as with regard to what is wanted or desired.
66. Sadness is a quite important affect. In sacred works, where
this emotion is most moving and beneficial,
it rules all these: penance,

remorse,
sorrow, dejection, complaint, and the recognition

misery.
(Eccl. 7). A writer we have already mentioned* gives a good reason
why most people prefer to hear sad rather than happy music, namely,
"almost everybody is unhappy!'
67. In secular music in which sadness has no special purpose,
there is, nevertheless,
infinite opportunity to use this fatal emotion as
well as its varying degrees and kinds. Each of these [kinds], according to its particular character, can give rise to particular inventions
and expressions

9. "Vielfaltige

Zusammenziehung
While the "contraction of intervals" is understandable
(see y57 above),
the contraction of "tones" or "sounds" does not have logical meaning.
It is probably of no importance,
since Mattheson most likely meant
nothing more than "intervals!' The translator of German in general and
of Mattheson in particular encounters this difficulty very often. Two
words are used either redundantly, as is probably the case here, or
the distinction between them is so subtle that it cannot be rendered in
English.

94. The rigaudon, by the way, is a real hermaphrodite,

Everything about it, its sections, its circumierence [Umfang], and its alternation, however, are quite different. In
older times this dance melody was simply called rigo by the Italians.23

Our next examination

concerns

V) la marche,
which can be either

the march or

[serious
[or droll [possierlich].

Its true character is heroic and fearless,
yet it is not wild or running.
It is therefore
wrong to make marches out of any sort of melody.
Dozens of composers
seem to think that a march can never be gay
enough. But, while it must not be plaintive, sad, pathetic, or tearful,
a jumping quality is, on the other hand, equally out of place. A march
is not really a dance. When it is used in the theatre the performers
walk quite slowly; they do not dance, hop, or jump. They do form figures that are pleasant to watch, especially when they are formed by
armed persons or warriors.
96. Triple time does not interfere with the seriousness
of such
melodies.
Lully has set many marches in uneven meter, without, however, depriving them of their pride and war-like character, to which he

of a hero. Too much fire does not make a real hero.
Rather he is
with a firm spirit that is unseated or shaken [becompletely fearless,
wegt] by nothing. Such a spirit is swayed neither by clever arguments
nor by heated passions. 2 The picture the composer should bear in
22. Mattheson, Das neu-eroffnete Orchestre (1713).
23. The origin of the word rigaudon appears to be quite uncertain.
Curt Sachs in his World History of the Dance (1937), p. 411, believes
that it must have some relationship
with rigodone, rigolone, Italian
words for "circle dance!'
24. The two sentences
describing heroic character are freely
translated
according to the meaning which, the translator feels, its

mind is not that of a raging fire but of courageous

warmth.

97. There are some occasions
when the march, too, changes
its quality. If, for example, I wanted to introduce a group of harlequins or clowns with a serious melody, it would be an inconsistency.
In such cases, the more ridiculous the march, the better.

When the courante is meant to be a dance, it has unbreakable rules that
the composer must observe precisely.
He may look them up in the
LNeu-eroffnete] Orchestre and in Niedt, etc. Only 3/2 time is permissible here.
122. If the melody is to be played on the keyboard, it may be
freer.
On the violin (not excluding the viola da gamba) it can hardly be
said to have any restrictions
except that it must justify its name by
constant running. It must always remain lovely and tender, however.
The vocal courante is closest to the dance-courante,
although it actually maintains only the tempo di corrente, not the entire form.
123. The piece de resistance [Meisterstiick] of the lutenists, especially in France, is usually the courante and the art and effort it requires are admittedly not wasted here. The passion or affect to be ex33. Friedrich Erhard Niedt, Musicalische

pressed by the courante is sweet hope. The melody contains much that
is courageous,
yearning, and happy, all the elements that together
make up hope.
124. Since no one has ever said or even thought this before, it
might be assumed that I am looking for something that is not present
in the thing itself, that I am inventing all this. However, I can demonstrate concretely that the above three particulars
and the resulting affect can and must be found in a courante.
Let us select an old wellknown melody, not only because the new ones depart from the rule, but
because it may be claimed that I wrote them to prove my statements.
I am sure that lovers of the lute will find my statement corroborated
in their courantes as it is in the following one.

Concerning Melodic Invention
(Selections from Part II, Chapter IV)
14. The first factors to be considered in musical invention are
thema, modus, tactus, i.e. subject, key, and meter.
These must be
well-chosen and established before anything further maybe considered,
whatever one intends to do.
15. The themata or subjects are the musical equivalent of the
orator's text or thesis [Unterwurff] and one must have a store of particular formulas that can be used in oratorical generalization. * This
means that, by experience and attentive listening to good music, the
little turns, clever passages,

38. Mattheson uses the German form of the word "Modulation!'
Obviously, a translation of this term by its English cognate would be
misleading, since he is not speaking of modulation inthe present meaning of the term. In 19 below, he uses the Latin word moduli (sing.
modulus) from which he seems to have derived the German cognate
even though the latter points to modulatio. Walther (op. cit. p. 409) lists

Since the notes change only in respect to their poevolutio or eversio.
sition, inversion does not involve any change in the form and timevalue of the notes but consists, in this case, of causing notes that previously rose to descend and of causing notes that previously descended
to rise; or of changing forward motion to backward motion, etc. These

may mean in other cases will, without fail be reported in the proper
place. In the meantime we have given the second manner of invention
under this heading. 48
29. The third manner towhich we are led bythe notational source
for which the technical name is
[of invention] consists of repetition,
clausula synonyma.
In fugal pieces it is called "the answer' i.e. a
certain phrase is transposed higher or lower.
30. By this device many pretty themes or subjects are invented
(not only for fugues, but even more for other things).
These may be
carried through or developed [durch- oder aus-gefiihret] very cleverly.
It is especially effective when a repeated phrase takes turns with other
intervening ones and is cleverly broughtback afterwards so that its return seems to be inevitable.
31. The answer is called repercussio
when one voice does not
merely repeat the same sounds uttered by another, but answers them
in the same form either higher or lower.
This can happen within one
voice as well. The ear loves almost nothing better than such a return
of a subject thathas already beenheard, especially when this is brought
about cleverly sothat it appears when it is least expected. That [pleasure] is natural, and all pleasures of the senses are of the same natural
character. 50
32. The fourth manner in which the category "place of notation"
leads us is taken from the canonic style and is uncommonly dignified,
if one does not limit oneself too much in using it. What actually constitutes this style has been discussed in Part I; however, the meaning of canons, how many kinds there are, and how they are made will
be shown more extensively in Part III. 52
33. Here, while discussing the doctrine of invention, we are not
dealing with formal canons but must limit ourselves to canonic imitarect English.

57. One can, for example, write a bass in such a manner that
at each new phrase the vocal part begins on a second, or - proceeding
the other way - the vocal part is written in such a manner, after each
phrase followed by a rest, that it allows the bass to begin again on a
fourth or sixth from the vocal part. 60 This will sound as agreeable as
it will seem strange.

directed only to this locus circumstantiorum,
since he discusses only
and consequentia. 69 These, after all,

concomitantia,
represent only one part of one locus out of fifteen.
79. Next we have locus comparationis
or comparison.
Here
similar things are juxtaposed with dissimilar ones, small and large, or

Into this category belongs the prose and poetry in which,
for the sake of allegory, persons are used to represent, for example,

mention only the various meters,
motions running counter to each
other, high and low pitches, fast and slow tempi, to show almost infinite possibilities
of invention arising from this device.
It does not
matter whether or not these are occasioned by a text.
81. Locus exemplorum is presumably to be interpreted as imitation of other composers.
One must, however, choose only the best
examples and change them so that theywill not just be copied or stolen.
When all has been said, it must be admitted that this source is used
most frequently.
As long as it is done modestly, it need not be condemned. Borrowing is permissible;
the loan, however, must be returned with interest; i. e. one must work out and dispose the borrowed
material in such ways that it will gain a better and more beautiful appearance than it had in the composition from which it came.

ought to be generous.
Even the greatest capitalists will borrow money when it is convenient
or advantageous.
83. The last source, locus testimoniorum,
consists of the use
of melodies composed by someone else and known to nearly everyone.
The church-hymns,
for example, are quoted in such ways that they become testimonials
to or endorsements
of the material which calls for
their use. They serve as citatum or allegatum and often have a very
fine effect.
We may consider this good invention, since such music is
69. Heinichen (Generalbass
i d. Comp., p. 30) establishes
the
above three terms as the main sources of invention.
He says that if a
composer is confronted by a "dry text" (c. f. footnote 8), out of which he
cannot draw any good ideas and which is not suited to "stimulate the
natural imagination"' he must look at the preceding text and try to get
an idea there.
If the aria, however, is at the beginning of a cantata,
opera, etc., he should look at the text that is to follow. Concomitantia
textus refers to the circumstances
under which the aria is to be sung,
i. e, the action may express an affect not mentioned in the text.
