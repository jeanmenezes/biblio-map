(a) The Intuition of Musical Space
The spaces of mathematics
are defined, constructed spaces,
composed of points held together by a system of relations func tioning in a homogeneous field. The mathematical notion of
symmetry is grounded in this conception of space. For two
imaginary sentient beings, x and y, located at the acute angles
of the figure below, theirrespective
worlds (consisting of nothing but a planar surface defined by lines and angles) appear as
being absolutely equivalent:

Y does not feel that he occupies a position "to the right of" x,
or that his world is the mirror image of, is behind, or on the
other side of x's world. Instead, y sees whatever x sees, exactly the way x sees it. This is what is meant by a purely relational space, and it is this sort of space which underlies the

the volume of tonal space in discrete steps until it becomes an
intense sliver of sound. The actual aural sensation is more
like the sketch shown as Example 10. According to the instructions accompanying the score, it is not mandatory to begin immediately with a solid wall of sound. But once the wall is fully

mentioned, the condition of complete stasis in music does not

seem a viable possibility,
(1) the static succession heard here is still a "state" of becoming, and is constantly renewing itself; (2) many of the textures in Volumina
are so broad that it is not difficult to wander around in them
and hear all sorts of mini-events and tiny motions within them.
This is because the activities involved in attending to the work
also constitute a motion. After all, the only listener is a live
one. Still, static succession is distinguishable from pure duration because something happens to the quality of staticness
itself; it doesn't really move, it doesn't really change, since
these words are applicable only to the moment when one state
becomes another state. I suppose, then, that both the staticness
and the change from state to state are necessary to distinguish
static succession from duration. And it is distinguishable from

In static succession it is impossible to hear anything going on
"within" (except the subliminal points mentioned above).
It
seems to me that "withinness" presupposes a more open texture, one which suggests the possibility for tones themselves
(and not just listeners) to get inside it. Volumina itself provides many such textures.

is reasserted
(it is marked as a "motionless cluster").
Because of all this activity, and because of the
kind of activity, a rhythmic perspective begins to unfold here,
so that, for the moment, one hears coordinated levels of activities and the sort of confined motion associated with moving
durations.
(c) Post hoc, ergo propter hoc
The final comparison to be made here is between the way intuitive and objective thought treat a certain logical fallacy,
namely, "after this, therefore because of this." Actually, this
is a fallacy only for objective thought, which, according to its
lights, rejects the notion that it is the robin who brings the
spring. But it need not be a fallacy for intuitive thought. In
music, we have on hand some simple examples of the validity
of this expression,
one of which is the function of the "introduction".
Now, whether or not the introduction is actually
written first or later, its aural impression is that it not only
introduces the main body of the work but brings it into existence, it engenders it. Once again, I am not talking about the
purely technical device whereby introductions are said to carry
the "germ" of later motivic development.
Nothing of the sort
need occur in order for introductions to function this way, pre cisely because the antiseptically-minded
analyst could never
talk about his germs if introductions did not inherently possess
this prior function.
Other examples include the operations of modulation and harmonic extension in tonal music.

a modulatory progression would be lost if we did not intuitively
hear it as bringing the new region into being. Similarly, we
can analyze certain harmonies as chromatic substitutes which
unfold a new and unexpected tonal space. Within the introduction to Beethoven's Sonata Op. 81a, it would be quite unmusical

If it strikes me that a discussion of feeling within an article on music theory is
off the beaten path, it is probably due to the lingering reverberations of the
putatively "scientific" outlook and vocabulary of many of the articles on theory
and analysis written in the sixties.
But the omission of such discussions has
served to confine unnecessarily the limits of music theory and to inject an atmosphere of reductionism into serious attempts at analysing feeling and, more
generally, consciousness itself. That feeling is decidedly not "nothing but" a
personal response and hence outside the realm of analytic discourse has been
demonstrated over and over again, and not just recently. The following excerpts are not intended, of course, to prove this point, since the positivists
among us can provide counter excerpts; they are offered here simply to provoke thought about the content, direction, and ultimate relevance of music
theory.
"The quick rhythm and the bright sounds of a Mozart rondo are definitely not
discouraged or solemn. They may even verge on the gay and irresponsible,
the overt disregard of the insistent wretchedness and difficulty of living. And
this disregard sharpens and brightens their loveliness,
making it for Mozart
himself, if we are to believe the quoted statements, the expression of actual
anguish, the pain with which our sincerest laughter is fraught. The slow, heavy
movement of a funeral march (literal slowness and literal heaviness or dullness in low-pitched, thick chords) is not gay, and may be extremely solemn.
If we ask what degree of the grave or solemn, the despairingly sad, it expresses,
