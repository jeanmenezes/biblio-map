the basis of the composer's studies throughout the Baroque and, in fact, never did disappear from the repertory of pedagogical theory.
The new attitude toward musical styles and the way of training
composers was as radical in the realm of music theory as
were the several new styles in composition which appeared in
the early Baroque. In later periods, as other new styles and
forms took the lead, more outdated practices, such as figured
bass and strict fugue, were preserved in the theory curriculum and were considered essential to the training of composers. The underlying assumption that the musical expression of
mood was brought about by a departure from the accepted
norm contributed to the acceleration of stylistic changes that

It is enlightening
to observe the changes
made in these cadences
