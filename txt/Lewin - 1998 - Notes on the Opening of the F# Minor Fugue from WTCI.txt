NOTES ON THE OPENING
OF THE Ft MINOR FUGUE
FROM WTCI

David Lewin

In a recentarticleI proposedanalyticstudyof this fugue using a graph
that lays out the variousforms of the pcset (013) in a certainformat.'A
version of that graph, somewhat modified for present purposes, is displayed below.
Until furthernotice, the graph is to be considered as extending indefinitelyin all directions.Formsof (013) that are displayedas adjacent
vertically include the same minor-seconddyad. Forms that are adjacent
include the same major-seconddyad. Forms
upper-left-and-lower-right
thatareadjacentlower-left-and-upper-right
include the same minor-third
dyad. In the cited article, I point out that "the analogous graph for...
harmonictriads would illustrate,in its three differentdirectionalbondings, Riemann's relations of our relative major/minor,of our parallel

On the graph as given here certain (013)-forms appearusing lowercase letternames. The reasonfor thatwill become clear lateron. At present, one can observethatthe lower-caseforms fill a connectedregion of
the graph.

shall carry out such an explorationfor the opening of the fugue. Interested readerscan then carry out an analogous exercise for the chorale
prelude,if so inclined.
The music example lays out "consecutiveforms of Forte-set3-2" at
the opening of the fugue, throughthe end of the Answer.The forms are
numberedin orderof appearance.
Forms 1 through9 and 12 through16
are melodic; forms 10, 11, and 17 arise in the contrapuntal
cross-talkbetween voices.
The figurereproducesthe lower-caseportionof the graph,with some
numericalannotations.The numberson the figurekey in to the numbers
on the music example:they label the variousforms of (013) thatoccur at
the opening of the fugue, in orderof appearance.
The reader'sattentionis drawnto the form {ft g# a} = {a ft g ), which
appearsboth at the lower left of the figure and at the upperleft, labeled
"1, 5, 10."This form is the only form thatoccurs in two different
places
on the figure. The phenomenonbefits the form's status as the "tonic"
(013)-form for the fugue. On the music example we see how {ft g# a}
opens the fugue as form 1, and how it cadences the Subject as form 5.
Later on we shall explore the special geometric meaning of form 10
the
when it "modularizes" figure,suturingtogetherthe upperleft with the
lower left.
Using the numberson the figure, and referringback to the music example as needed, we can see how the Subjectof the fugue, which comthe
space of the
prises forms numbered1 through5, "surfs" metaphorical
figure:startingat the lower left of the figure(with the form labeled "1"),
it moves up two ranks and over one column to the right (form labeled
"2");then it repeatsthatgesture,againmoving up two ranksandover one
column to the right(formlabeled "3");afterthatit sinks back down to its

The Answercomprisesforms labeled6, 8, 12, 15, and 16. Being a real

Now let us examine the Countersubject, melody thataccompanies
the
the Answer.It begins by presentingforms 7 and 9. On the figure,we see
how form 7 fills in the one "missing"form in the region traversed the
by
subject(forms 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). Form9, which restatesform 4, is not necesmotivic
sary to do any work of filling-in. Form 9 ratherhas a particular
relationto form 7, which directly precedes it within the Coungestural
tersubject.Specifically, the move from form 7 to form 9 is down two
ranksand over one column to the left. That is the inverse gesture to the
move "up-two-ranks-and-over-one-column-to-the-right,"
the motivic rismove within the Subject.To be sure,the inversionalrelationbetween

do not need the fancy spatial map of the figure to hear the relation as
such. What the map does bringout is the way in which the particular

gion on the figure.Thatregion comprisesthe forms labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
7, and9. Even thoughthis tally neglects the temporallyinterveningforms
6 and 8 of the music as a whole, the observationis still cogent, for forms
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9 are indeed temporallyconsecutive within the individual voice thatopens the fugue with the Subjectand then continueson
to the Countersubject.
Form 10, which involves the first (013)-vertical cross-talk between
Answer andCountersubject,
solidifies the narrative farby restatingthe
so
same trichordas that of forms 1 and 5, the incipit-and-cadence
trichord
of the Subject.The readercan see on the upperleft of the figurehow form
10, as discussed earlier,suturestogetherthatplace on the figurewith the
lowerleft, modularizing geometry.Thereaderis reminded,in this conthe
nection, that form 10 is the "tonic"(013) of the fugue, and that its pcset
is the only pcset of the figurewhich appearsin two locations thereon.
Continuingto examine the upperhalf of the figurewe can follow the
Answer,which proceedsthroughforms 6, 8, 12, 15, and 16. The one gap
on the figureleft unfilled by the Answer is the gap at form 11. The spatial function of form 11 (which sounds temporallyin the middle of the
Answer) is now clear.Form 11 does for the Answer what form 7 did for
the Subject:it fills in a gap to connect the spatialregion traversed the
by
Answer.
Form 11 also connects to the "Answer-region" form labeled "1, 5,

the
10",thatis the formwhich characterizes beginningof the Subject,the
end of the Subject,and the firstcross-talkbetweenAnswer and Countersubject.In sum, we see how the two cross-talkforms 10 and 11 have special spatial functions on the figure, in suturingtogether and connecting
the spatialrealmsof SubjectandAnswer.5
has
Form 14, the final form of the Countersubject, a like function:it
connects the "highpoint"of the Subjecton the map, form 3, recalled as
form 13, to the (local tonic) "lowpoint"of theAnswer,form6. The crossand
talk of Countersubject Answer, at form 17, cements the connection.6
And so, when we reach the end of the passage at issue, at the end of the
the
Answer-cum-Countersubject, entire map of the figure is fully filled
in, is completely connected,and is cyclically closed-the {a f# g#} at the
top left linking cyclically with the {f# g# a} at the bottomleft.
