HARMONIC
AFTER

THEORY
THE

TIME

IN

ENGLAND

OF

RAMEAU

by
Erwin R. Jacobi
In the year that Rameau died, a man travelled from England to
Paris whose personality and work were to have a decisive influence on
the attitude of the English musical world toward developments on the
European continent for decades to come: Charles Burney2. Even though
1. This article is a translation
from the German of the first
chapter of a doctoral dissertation presented at the University of Zurich,
Switzerland, the full title of which is The Development of Music Theory
in England after the time of Jean-Philippe Rameau.
The preface, introduction and first chapter of the dissertation,
together with the complete table of contents and bibliography of sources, appeared earlier
this year in German as Volume 35 of the Sammlung Musikwissenschaftlicher Abhandlungen, P. H. Heitz, Strasbourg.
This first chapter of
the dissertation is concerned with the developments in England from the
time of Rameau's death in 1764 to the publication in 1845 of the most influential and all-embracing theory of harmony to come from nineteenthcentury England, that of Alfred Day.
The translation is by David Kraehenbuehl.
Those who compare
this translation with any of the published versions in the original language will discover that all the direct quotations from the English treatises cited have been paraphrased in the German versions of the article.
The author and editor felt that these would be most useful to English
readers if they were presented in their exact wording. Readers who
are unfamiliar with the technical terms of harmonic theory that appear
in treatises
of the time will find thorough explanations of these in
Matthew Shirlaw's The Theory of Harmony, reprinted in 1955 in Dekalb,
Illinois by Birchard Coar. The section of this article concerned with
the work of Kollmann was published separately in German in the Archiv
fur Musikwissenschaft,
Vol. XIII, Nr. 3/4, 1956, pp. 263-270.
2. Charles Burney (1726-1814)
has gone down in history as a
leading music historian on the basis of his A General History of Music
(the first in the English language) which appeared in four substantial
volumes in the years 1776 to 1789. With the exception of John Hawkins'
historical work (cf. page 130), which appeared a few months later than
Burney's first volume in 1776, it was almost 125 years before another
work of equal stature and scope appeared in the English language in the
form of the OxfordHistory of Music. In 1770, Burney began his
journeys
to France, Italy, Holland, Germany and Austria in order to
gather authentic materials on the spot for his planned historical work; smaller
publications appeared already in 1771 (on France and Italy) and in 1773
(onGermany and Holland). Burney married a sister of the English poet,
William Cowper (also written Cooper); he knew how to work himself
up
into an almost unexampled position of influence socially and how to
126

Burney was no music theorist (as we shall see, some of his statements
in this area demonstrate a considerable

superficiality),
prominent mention here because his comments on Rameau undoubtedly
made a lasting impression
in England.
In the fourth volume of his
great history of music, five and one-half pages (p. 612 ff. ) are devoted
to Rameau's theories:
"After frequent perusals and consultations of Rameau's theoretical works, and a long acquaintance with the writings of his learned
commentator D'Alembert, and panegyrists,
the Abbe Roussier, M. de
la Borde3 etc. if any one were to ask me to point out what was the discovery or invention upon which his system was founded, I should find it
a difficult task.
"The base to a common chord has been known ever since the first
attempts at counterpoint; and it only seems as if Rameau had given new
names to old and well-known combinations,
when he calls the keynote,
with R, Generateur, Basse-fondamentale.
But the Italians, ever since
the time of Zarlino, have distinguished this lowest sound by calling it
the first base, Imo. basso; and the other parts of the chord when made
the base, basso rivoltato, or 2do. basso.
But Brossard in his Musical
Dictionary, published 1702, in defining Trias harmonica, or the three
sounds of a common chord in its first state, calls the under-note basse,
or son fondamental; and afterwards
remarks that among the three
sounds that compose the Triade harrnonique, the gravest is called
And what has Rameau told us more,
basis, or sonus fundamentalis.
except that that the harmoniques produced by a string or pipe, which he
does not pretend to have first discovered,
are precisely the third and
fifth in question. This is the practical principle of the fundamentalbase;
the theoretic was surely known, of harmonical, arithmetical,
and geometrical proportions and ratios of sound, with which so many books
have been ostentatiously filled ever since the time of Boethius.
"The Abbe Roussier, his most learned apostle and able champion,
candidly confessed in his first work, that 'the system of a fundamental
base ought not tobe regarded as one of those principles which precedes
the consequences tobe deduced from it. Le m4rite du cette decouverte
consiste, h avoir reduit en un systeme simple, commode, et facile a
saisir, toutes les operations des grands maltres de l'harmonie.' Traite
des Accords, 1764. "
Burney continues:
"Rameau's system, as compressed
and arranged by D'Alembert
(Elemens de Mus. Theor. et Prat. suivans les Principes de Rameau,
make his house a center for the highest circles not only in the arts, but
in the political and scientific
worlds as well; Joseph Haydn visited
Burney first after his arrival in England, and personal friendships
bound him to George III, Queen Charlotte, Burke, Pitt, Johnson, Boswell, and numerous other leading personalities.

conducted in a considerably milder fashionl); a single statesman,
Edmund Burke8, succeeded in prejudicing the overwhelming
majority of the English people in every class against the ideology of the French revolution with his own views regarding
state government as presented in his Reflections on the French
Revolution published in 1790, as well as his political actions
while prime minister of England.
In the same year, but shortly after the appearance of the first
volume of Burney's history, another history appeared in the English
language: John Hawkins, A General History of the Science and Practice
of Music (1776; new edition: London, 1853). Hawkins, long regarded
as a rival of Burney, contented himself largely with the establishment
and presentation of facts, with little personal commentary.
With regard to Rameau, he writes (1853 edition, page 900 ff.):
"But the work for which Rameau is most celebrated
is his
'Demonstration
du Princips de l'Harmonie', Paris 1750, in which, as
his countrymen say, he has shewn that the whole depends upon one
single and clear principle, viz., the fundamental bass: and in this respect he is by them compared to Newton, who by the single principle
of gravitation was able to assign reasons for some of the most remarkable phenomena in physics; for this reason they scruple not to style
Rameau the Newton of Harmony...
As a theorist,
the character of
Rameau stands very high; and as a testimony to his merit in this particular, it is here mentioned as a fact, that Mr. Handel was ever used
to speak of him in terms of great respect."
It should be pointed out here that, during Rameau's lifetime, the
third part of his Traite de l'Harmonie, reduite a ses Principes naturels
(Paris, 1722, Livre III, "Principes de Composition") was translated
into English (appearing in London in 1737 under the title "A treatise of
Musick, containing the Principles of Composition, wherein the several
parts thereof are fully explained and made useful both tothe professors
and students of that science, " second edition, 1752). Towards the end
of the eighteenth century an English translation of the fourth
part of the
Traite ("Principes d'Accompagnement") was published in London (under
the title "A Treatise on Harmony, in which the Principles of
Accompaniment are fully explained and illustrated by a
variety of Examples").
Around the turn of the century an English translation of Catel's instruction book, renowned in France, appeared under the title "A Treatise on
Harmony, Written and Composed for the use of the Pupils of the Royal
Conservatoire of Music in Paris. "
In order to establish what portions of Alfred
Day's system of
theory were taken over from earlier works, what were revisions
of
earlier works, and what were original contributions
by Day, it is necessary to know what theories existed in England prior to the publication

questions from Day himself or from his disciples, opponents, or critics;
are discovered tothe effect that,

prior to the publication of his work, there existed in music theory only
a chaos of countless rules and exceptions to rules without any system
at all.
Of the innumerable, often remarkably penetrating, complete, and
clear publications whose titles indicate that they are basic tracts in the
realm of harmonic theory, only those will be considered here that have

one of earnest theoretical endeavor, its writers were not granted the
opportunity, in the long run, to found any national school or tendency.

enced for the most part by continental theorists,

whatsoever, the basic questions of the nature and derivation of musical
materials.

who had studied in France and Germany, knew the most important theoretical works of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries from
those countries in the original.

1883. This book is important because of its comprehensive references
to literature and its accomplished
correlation of the most various aspects of notation, melody, harmony, and rhythm.

in the same chapter, how the asAfter Jones has demonstrated,
cending and descending major scale can be harmonized without modulating, using only the acceptable scale tones from the basic harmonies
of the tonic, dominant, and subdominant, he explains in closing: "I do
not add an Example of the Minor Key in this place, because the case is
not so simple, as the degrees of the Minor Key do not furnish an harmonic accompaniment to the Notes of the Octave when taken as Basses,
even in descending, and much less in ascending: so I reserve this till
we come to the Doctrine of Modulation. "

on the tone B in the C-major scale) are contrasted with "fundamental

In dealing with the inversion of chords and their "internal consonance" it is observed: "if the Notes of which a Chord consists be taken
severally from above, and put below as Basses, the harmony will be
changed. This is called the Inversion of a Chord, to produce new relations and great variety arises in Music upon this principle."

various arrangements of the chord tones (above an identical bass tone),
through which, according to him, the degree of "internal consonance"
can be noticably varied.
From this observation he demonstrates also
the admissibility of certain dissonances.
In order of importance, according to Jones, "the first and most
agreeable of the discords" is the fourth taken together with the fifth and
octave above the bass (5); next comes the ninth, as dominant of the

dominant; and only third in his arrangement
seventh, "commonly accounted the chief" discord, but which "is inferior
on several considerations. " Here again the abovementioned principle
of "internal consonance" plays a role; and, further, the various possibilities for resolution are important in the designation and classification of dissonances.
Of particular interest is Jones's basis for ordering individual dissonant chords: it is the sum of the consonant intervals
in the chord compared with the sum of the dissonant intervals in the
chord, the resulting relationship being inthis case synonymous with the
"internal consonance" (e.g., the chord G-B-D-F consists of four consonant and two dissonant intervals); and, on the basis of this relationship, certain dissonant chords are more bearable to the ear than
others.
In establishing the derivation of the fundamental bass from
certain dissonant chords, Jones proceeds exactly as Rameau, whom he
also cites in this case.
In the chapter "of Modulation, its Forms and Limits," the minor
scale is explained as a kind of modulation of the major scale with no
attempt being made to derive it theoretically.
(In support of this, examples are introduced from Gibbons, Tartini, Corelli, and "from a
Movement of Geminiani universally admired. ")
Jones understands "Harmonic Periods" to mean sequences, for
the study of which he again recommends Morley in particular, and then
cites also certain passages from Pergolesi's
Stabat Mater and from
Carissimi.
The "Chromatic System" has its sources,
according to
Jones, in the minor scale and in the variable nature of the sixth and
seventh, as well as the third.

In 1796 he published his first theoretical work on harmony: "An Essay
on Musical Harmony, according to the Nature of that Science and the

edition of his Essay on Practical Musical Composition in 1799, to publish the WTC for the first time, but he never came to any realization of
this plan. In the second edition of the aforementioned work on composition, appearing in 1812, Kollmann writes (Chapter 11, "Of Instrumental
Music, " section 21, page 62): "In the first edition of the present Essay,
I announced an analyzed edition of his [J. S. Bach's] forty-eight Preludes and Fugues, entitled the Well Tempered Clavier, which had never
been printed before. But as three editions of it were taken in hand soon
after, viz. at Zurich, Bonn, and Leipzig, and numerous copies of them
imported into this country, I relinquished the intended edition and attempted my Twelve Analyzed Fugues, which I have lately published."
(This last refers to Kollmann's own compositions.)
Besides numerous examples from various works of J. S. Bach
and other composers, Kollmann printed from the WTC only the Prelude
and Fuge in C major (Book I) in his composition manual (1799) and, in
the second edition (1812), the Prelude and Fugue in C major (Book II).
In the first number (only two numbers appeared altogether) of a
trade paper, The quarterly musical Register,
of which Kollmann was
editor, he published merely a note on J. S. Bach and his works, in no
sense "An Analysis of S. Bachs Preludes and Fugues, " as W. Schmieder
still writes erroneously
on page 510 in the section on literature in his
Verzeichnis

this in the same place cited above: "The greatest Composer for keyed
as well as the greatest Performer
instruments,
on them ever known,
has been John Sebastian Bach, some of whose works have been quoted
in the preceeding part of this Essay; and an account of him maybe found
in the Musical Register, No. 1. "
Schweitzer takes his erroneous statements regarding Kollmann
from Hermann Kretzschmar's
closing commentary to the old Bach Gesellschaft Edition (Volume 46, Leipzig, 1896, "Bericht und Verzeichnisse, " page xxiv) which he expressly quotes. In this place, Kretzschmar deals with the English Bach-movement
of the late eighteenth century and speaks indeed of the "important" Kollmann edition of the WTC
from 17991
It is possible that Kretzschmar,
for his part, was under the influence of Ernst Ludwig Gerber's
Neues historisch-biographisches
Lexikon der Tonkunstler (1813), in the third part of which
(page 91 ff. )
is actually written that Kollmann had edited at London, in
engraved
form, Johann Sebastian Bach's WTC with explanatory remarks!
In the
same place, Gerber writes regarding Kollmann: "This active man took
it upon himself to acquaint the English, through his
pen, with what German industry and German art had accomplished
in music.
This was
carried out especially
in his Essay on Practical Musical Composition.
In addition, he belongs among the prolific composers.

works of Haydn, Mozart, and others; they gained without doubt their full

works were brought out in more than a single edition, andKollmann occupied a central position in the musical life of London, particularly as
a teacher in the German colony there. In his first work on harmony,
he follows principally
Johann Philipp Kirnberger,
whose system he
claims with pride to have introduced to England. 4 He holds it to be
the best of the theoretical works known up to that time. Nevertheless,
over a period of ten years following this publication, he discovered
that this system was still not complete and he undertook to correct
these deficiencies.
The result of these efforts was his book, A New
Theory, as he writes in the preface of this work. 25
22. Eighteen pages of introduction,
128 pages of text, and 40
pages of musical examples, in quarto.
23. Eighty-four pages of text and 36 pages of musical examples.
24. Cf. the two principal works of Kirnberger:
1) Die wahren
Grundsatze zum Gebrauch der Harmonie (1773), and 2) Die Kunst des
reinen Satzes in der Musik (1774-1779).
Kirnberger declares himself
primarily against Rameau and still more against his prophet, Marpurg.
He recognizes only the triad and the seventh chord, to be sure on every
step of the diatonic scale, as the starting point for a complete harmony.
25. For the sake of completeness
we must mention here the
somewhat superficial comment on Kollmann's theoretical works in the
Biographie universelle des Musiciens (second edition, 1866)of Francois
Joseph Fetis: according to this, Kollmann wishes, in his first work, to
amalgamate two contradictory
theories,
namely those of Kirnberger
and Marpurg, and therefore
could not realize any unified approach;
Kollmann became aware of this himself in later years after he came to
know the system of Balliere who had constructed,
in 1764, a music
theory based on the tones of the hunting horn, respectively those of the
trumpet (Theorie de la Musique); Jamard (who is actually mentioned by
in his own theoretical
work in 1769 (Recherches
Kollmann),
sur la
theorie de la musique), developed the ideas of Balliere and established
a complete series of hunting horn tones instead of the diatonic scale,
usual until then, in which he replaced the geometric ratios in the calculation of intervals of Balliere's reckoning with arithmetic ones which
also proved to be wrong.
(Kollmann refers to the indicated work of
Jamard in a single place, and that only in his first theoretical work
which appeared in 1796-in his second chapter on intervals, the fourth
part concerning consonances and dissonances,
page 11 ff., in conjunction with his description of the natural intervals 4:7 and 7:8. ) This
reference is of interest primarily because, seen through Fetis' eyes,
it demonstrates
an alleged error which can come about through a
search for some "naturalistic" bases for music.
This comment of Fetis is taken up and reiterated similarly by
Lucien Chevaillier in his voluminous chapter on "Les Theories Harmoniques" in the Encyclopedie de la Musique (Alb. Lavignac--L.
de
la Laurencie),
part 2, the volume entitled "Technique-Esthetique138

Kollmann begins the introduction of his first book with these
words: "The science of music may be brought under two general heads,
viz.: that, of just harmony, and that, of practical composition."

shows parallels to both in the field of language. He begins immediately

all musical harmony, even the most complicated,
if only regular, is
reducible to the said two chords; the fundamental note of which is called

These two chords and their inversions therefore, may be called essential chords, in distinction from those which I
shall call accidental ones. " The harmonic system (i. e., in reality the
Kirnberger system) which underlies all of Kollmann's work rests on
the distinction between essential and accidental chords, in contrast
with those systems in which each chord or each tonal combination was

mann quotes in detail how Rameau, Marpurg, and Kirnberger derive
and use these chords.
According to him, in Kirnberger the attention
of the student and the performer is drawn to an essential chord by the
appearance of any accidental chord while, on the other hand, in Rameau
and Marpurg, the attention is diverted from the essential chords and
each accidental chord must be recognized and figured as essential.
In the demonstration of cadences,
Kollmann speaks of the then
famous chord of the "sixte ajoutee" (F-A-C-D in C major), as it was
named by Rameau.
Kollmann distinguishes
two kinds of "imperfect
cadence":
1)

the "half cadence" or "retrograde perfect cadence"
which proceeds from tonic to dominant and in which
the first chord must be a major or minor triad; the
second, a major triad or a dominant-seventh
chord.

2)

Kollmann explains

it in the last chapter:

"The two lowest staves contain the fundamental concord and discord, as the two only roots, from which all harmony arises, according
to the nature of our modern scale.

can be distinguished,

from the real nature

The systems of the first group appear to be simple but are by no
means so in reality.
These systems know no rules by which to distinguish the false from the proper, the appearance from the fact; the
an equivalent variety of
variety of individual appearances
requires
rules in these systems; and should one desire to organize the plethora
of instances under some general rules, one must also introduce countless rules for the exceptions.
These systems were still possible as
explanations of harmonic phenomenon so long as only a few chords and
were regarded as permissible;
progressions
they were made obsolete
as soon as the doctrine of a fundamental bass was recognized.
Kollmann includes Rameau's system in the second group (on the
basis of the Traite, published in 1722 and translated into English in
1752)28:
"The chief leading principle in Rameau's system is: that all harmony must be reducible to a regular fundamental bass, as the proof of
it. And in that respect it is perfectly true.
"But its inventor

mistake, of explaining

endeavoured to reconcile that leading principle,
of considering and explaining every interval and
individual appearance; and this led him into the
some suspensions
as a sort of essential chords,
of chords by supposition. "

Kollmann regards it as remarkable howRameau had realized that
all his chords by supposition could be explained simply as suspensions.
in his Traite des Accords et de leur Succession selon le
Roussier,
systeme de la Basse Fondamentale (1764), spoke of suspensions similarly but still more forcefully.
Marpurg differed from Rameau insofar
as he (in his thoroughbass handbook, 1755) made the "supposed" thirds
into fundamental tones; but the whole doctrine of chords by supposition
were an error since they concern, as previously said, only suspensions.
28. It might be assumed from Kollmann's formulations that the
entire Traite existed in English translation; on the other hand, every
official bibliographical
source (the catalogues of the Library of the
British Museum and of the Library of Congress in Washington,
among
others) speaks only of an English translation of the third and fourth
of the Traite in the eighteenth century.
parts
It appears likelyto me
that Kollmann, because of the English title (see page 130)
might have been
led to the erroneous notion that it was a complete translation.
My supposition is further supported by the fact that the second edition of the
translation of the third part and the translation cited by Kollmann bear
identical dates of publication and identical wordings for the main title.
Burney fell into a similar error when he named "Rameau's Treatise on
1752" in his "chronological list of the important
Music, translated.
books which have been published on music in the present
century in
England" (at the end of the last volume of his music history, published
in 1789).
142

Like Rameau, Tartini is said to belong also to this second group
with his Trattato di Musica (1754), and his De Principii dell' Armonia
Musicale (1767). Tartini is said to understand (according to Stillingfleet's translation29)
only a complete chord under the concept of
"system," but not the leading of one chord to another.
All the previous works written on harmony had favored more or
less the old method-to
designate each interval and each harmony for
itself.
But the more one does this, the more complicated the system
must become. If rules have been given for a thousand combinations, so

berger alone, who unfortunately stopped half-way - more than half of
all the tones and tone-combinations
that are useful in music are left
unconsidered too arbitrarily
and are not included in his system
so
that it remained incomplete.
In completing Kirnberger, he, Kollmann,
had succeeded, on the basis of his studies and teaching, in making a
more comprehensive
and complete system since 1796 "by which every
note that is useful in music might have as positive a rule, as it denotes
a positive sound," not, as with Kirnberger, just the principal and essential tones, but also as systematically
all unessential and accidental
tones.
Kollmann, who generally achieves an objective tone, even when
he speaks of his opponents, cannot resist observing the following: that
just as America existed always before its discovery by Europeans, so
did his system exist in the natural feelings of all previous good composers and authors, for all good tracts and compositions
show that
their authors felt what he (Kollmann) has demonstrated in his system,
even if the authors could not have explained matters in the form of a
complete theory; the stronger the natural feeling of these composers
was, the less did their compositions
take exception to the rules of his

system.
Tartini, Marpurg, and other famous composers whose theories differ
from those presented in his present work.
The contents of his new system are summed up in his book, A
Second Practical Guide to Thorough-Bass
(1807), with the words: "all
intervals and chords, which are in relation to others, shall not
only be
alone but also according to those qualities
designated for themselves
which they acquire from their relationship,
and every note shall be
given a positive rule as it has a positive sound. "

29. Benjamin Stillingfleet (1702-1771),
an English writer, occupied himself with botany, agriculture, poetry, and music.
His last
work, to which Kollmann refers here, appeared anonymously in 1771
and was an annotated analysis of Tartini's Trattato;
Burney praised this
work of Stillingfleet highly. Stillingfleet is as
strong an opponent of
Rameau as he is a follower of Tartini whose treatise,
as he writes in
his foreword, he wishes to explain in an easier form for music lovers.
143

In 1800, Matthew P. King30 published "A General Treatise on
Music, particularly
on harmony or thoroughbass and its application in
Composition, " the second edition of which appeared in 1809. He begins
his book with an empty polemic against Kollmann who he assumes to
have written primarily against himself and Shield31: "finally, since Mr.
Kollmann has called for and provoked an opinion on his innovating
system, I think myself fully justified, from the written testimonies of
the highest authorities,
as well as from the greatest Professors
in this
Country, to say, that it not only annihilates all the higher branches of
Harmony, but, compared with the received principles,
which he arrogantly attempts to overthrow and supplant, that the crude notions he
would substitute in their place, are at once puerile, fallacious,
and incomplete. "32 King confesses unmistakably his high regard for Rameau
and Marpurg.
(The King-Kollmann controversy
recalls the similarly
conducted quarrel over similar matters between Marpurg and Kirnberger in Germany a few decades earlier. ) The book contains some
excellent practical compilations,
as, for example, of all the usual ornamental signs in use up to that time and their performance,
but it is a
long way from being an independent theoretical work.
King takes over in its entirety the doctrine by which the whole
harmonic system is built on two chords alone, the fundamental consonance and the fundamental dissonance; he calls them the chords of
nature and, on the other hand, those which are derived from them, the
chords of art. He understands the "new system" to be "another
system,
entirely different from either of the former, and wholly founded on the
principles of vibration; or the natural succession
of sounds, " and that
the chords of the ninth, eleventh, and thirteenth
may be independently
constructed by the stacking of thirds upward.
In the last part of his book, "on the Application

recognition.

a composer much-loved by the
English public, primarily on account of his serene operas and musical
plays, published, like many of his contemporaries,
a practical guide to
harmony and an introduction to the principles of thoroughbass.
32. A sensitive ear might discern here a kind of
injured national
pride and animosity toward the stranger from foreign lands; it is wellknown that, at this time, broad ranks of the
English people, particularly in the countryside,
were openly against the foreign ruling family
and its associates.

William Crotch33, perhaps the most popular personality in the
English musical scene of his time and professor of music at Oxford for
almost half a century, published his book, "Elements of Musical Composition: comprehending the Rules of Thorough Bass and the Theory of
Tuning," in 1812. The unusually energetic musical activity and dein contrast with those on the
velopment in the English universities,
of Crotch. 34 It is not an excontinent, begins with the professorship
aggeration to assert that the strongest impulse was given English musical life, and therefore naturally the development of music theory, by
the universities.
The contents of Crotch's book, from the point of view of music
theory, would not indicate, at least at the time of its appearance,
a
particularly high standard at Oxford University.
(It is known that the
of Oxford and Cambridge Universities
was greater in the
significance
sixteenth than in the eighteenth century; the situation was improved
again in the nineteenth century. ) Only in the last chapter are questions
of music theory considered.
Until then, for the most part, rules and
facts are listed without any foundation or derivation in any scientific
sense.
In this chapter, Crotch speaks, among other matters, of the
derivation of scales, tuning, temperament,
and the monochord.
After
a brief exposition of the scale derivations of Pythagoras,
Ptolemy and
Tartini, it is explained in great detail how it is possible to derive
scales exactly only by means of a monochord.
It appears that, despite the presumptuous makeup of the book and
the prominent position of its author, its content was designed
primarily
for musical beginners, as the author himself indicates at the
beginning
of the preface:
"a knowledge of the Elements of Musical Composition
and of Thorough Bass is happily become almost indispensable to a Musical Education. "
Without doubt Kollmann's complete theoretical
works are the
most significant of this time in England, as much with regard to their
33. William Crotch (1775-1847) appeared as a musical
prodigy
already at four years of age; Burney reports on him in 1779. He became an organist, theorist, and composer, professor
of music at Oxford at the age of 24, in 1822, director of the Royal Academy of Music
in London. His book on composition appeared in a new edition in
1856;
his oratorio, Palestine,
as W. Barclay Squire writes in his article on
Crotch in the Dictionary of NationalBiography
(1888), "achieved a lastand remains practically
ing success,
the one oratorio by an English
composer which has survived for half a century. "
34. In 1844 only the universities
of Oxford and Cambridge had
for music; in 1944 around thirty English universities
professorships
had music professorships,
not counting the number of university colleges that had not yet been recognized as complete universities.
With
regard to this, see Percy A. Scholes, "The Mirror of Music, 18441944, A Century of Musical Life in Britain as reflected in the pages of
the Musical Times,"
1947, Vol. 2, Chapter XIX: "The Universities
and Music, " page 649 ff.

look. However, since the author was a foreigner who was conscious of
his reliance upon a master of his native land (Kirnberger),
his work
made no lasting impression on the future; his influence remained associated with his own person as an author and his immediate circle.
Of the remaining theorists of this time, who, unlike Kollman, are
of English ancestry, Jones is undoubtedly the most serious.
A churchman, and above all a scholar, rooted in traditions from the distant past
and conservative
in his musical theoretical
attitudes, he found nothing
of importance in the musical activities of the time in his homeland upon
which he could fasten his attention.
The two mentioned works of King and Crotch remain in the area
of guides for purely practical purposes put together out of tried and
true materials;
but nothing
they are good and useful compendiums
more.
These closing remarks may serve to explain the fact that the few
modern works concerned with the history of theory - in England
proper, Matthew Shirlaw's The Theory of Harmony (London, 1917; reover this period in absolute silence
print: Dekalb, Illinois, 1955)-pass
in their discussion of English developments.
