THE

MINOR

MODE

IN

sonata form have principally conInvestigators of Classic-era
fined their studies to works in the major mode. *1 Such studies
present fewer problems to the investigator owing to the clear
tonal direction to the dominant in the first part of the movement and the drive back to the tonic in the second part. So
many problems, it seems to be generally felt, remain to be
solved in the study of the sonata form that examination of those
deviant works in minor can be deferred. *2 Furthermore, the
percentage of sonata form movements in minor is relatively
small in comparison to the number in major. *3 On the other
inhand, there has been an increasing interest in Classic-era
strumental cycles in minor, exemplified by William Newman's

This study of the minor mode in eighteenth-century

diverges from the major: first theme-groups, transitions, the
second half of the exposition, and recapitulations,
with brief
mention of the sonata form and the instrumental cycle as wholes.
I have followed a descriptive-taxonomic

Two explanations
affinity of tonic minor and mediant major are possible:
two triads share two common tones and (2) a tradition
from the Hypodorian mode, whose finalis is D and whose
tone (so-called

198
sonata forms in minor with mediant major as the goal of the
exposition shows a variety of approaches which can be grouped
in the following categories:
1. The absence of a transition, wherein a self-contained theme,
usually eight or sixteen measures long, cadences on its tonic
or its dominant; there is a caesura, usually complete in all
parts but occasionally melodic only (J.C. Bach, Sonata in C
material imminor, Op. 17/2, I, m. 11); then second-theme
ensues in the mediant. In the second movement of
mediately
Haydn's Symphony No. 49, after the caesura the music resumes
in the mediant, but not yet with the second theme.
2. The most prevalent type of transition consists of a statefirst theme

the longest section; in contrast, one can regard measures 1922 in the first movement of Mozart's C minor Piano Sonata, K.
457, as the quintessence of the tonic-mediant transition compressed within four measures.
(b) In most of these transitions, connections between tonic minor
and mediant major are smoothly handled without sharply defined
breaks; the transition in the first movement of Haydn's Quartet
Op. 50/4 is a "classic" example. Aparticularly effective treatment occurs in the first movement of Haydn's Symphony no. 39:
statement of the firstpart of the first theme in tonic minor (mm.
13-16); statement of the first part of this portion in mediant major (mm. 17-20), after which the new tonic is firmly established.
In the recapitulation this effect is paralleled by statement of this
material in dominant minor, then dominant major (mm. 95-97).
Much rarer is an abrupt and surprising shift in the course of
transition to the new key, as shown in Example 5.

supertonic of the new mediant and thus serves not only as a pivot
but also as a means of establishing a grand cadence of ii-V-I
in the mediant, as (to cite early Classic examples) in the first
movements of Rutini's Sonata in D minor, Op. 3/4, and Franz
Beck's Sinfonia in D minor, Op. 3/5. Another pivotal harmony

is the submediant of tonic minor as the subdominant of the
mediant, as seen in the first movements of Haydn's C# minor
and B minor Sonatas, and treated abruptly in the first movement of Mozart's E minor Violin Sonata, K.304.
Even the
minor dominant of the old tonic can be used as a pivot, for it is
the mediant of the new key, as shown in Example 6.
(d) Elements of the minor form of the new major key, either
subdominant minor or a tonic minor with a strong emphasis on
the dominant, parallel to the iv-I effect, intensify the new tonic;
As an illustration,
this is one of Mozart's favorite devices.
Mozart begins the transition of the first movement of his A minor Sonata, K. 310, with a statement of the opening of the first
theme, then a shift to the mediant through its subdominant; after
the new tonic is prepared, minor tonality rather than the expected major (mm. 16-22) ensues through the remainder of the

whether in harmonized or unison passages, especially to prepare the cadence of the first half of the exposition.
3. A third category of transitions begins thematically with new
material and tonally in the original tonic or its harmonic orbit,
less often in the harmonic orbit of the mediant but not directly
on it, and more rarely in a tonal area common to but rather
distant from both tonics.
(a) An excellent early example of the first type is the first
movement of J.G. Eckardt's Piano Sonata Op. 1/2, published
in 1763; the first movement of Rutini's Sonata Op. 3/4 is similar but less clearly defined. Eckhardt begins his transition
in the tonic with new thematic material (subsequently excised
from the recapitulation) with an ensuing progression to the
subdominant to establish a pivot for a grand ii-V-I cadence on
the mediant.
(b) The second type embraces an abrupt shift to the tonal area
of the mediant but not its pure tonic; usually the new tonic is
treated as V7 of IV, as in the first movement of Haydn's C minor Piano Sonata. His procedure is smoother in the first move ment of his Quartet Op. 17/4, since the close similarity of the
opening theme to the opening of the transition provides greater
unity (Example 7).
(c) More unusual is the beginning of the transition on a scale
degree not closely related to either the tonic or the mediant.
The transition in the finale of Haydn's Quartet Op. 17/4 (C
minor) begins in G minor with a new contrapuntal treatment of

the opening motive. The most unusual specimen is the transition in the second movement of Haydn's Quartet Op. 55/2: after
the theme cadences in the home tonic (F minor) there is a
grand pause after which the theme begins in the flat supertonic
(Gf major) and then modulates to the mediant.

"subordinate" themes, but to demonstrate the fluid character
of thematic or motivic material in sonata form. Furthermore,
this concept is often better perceived aurally than definedverbally.

ciple, wherein second-theme motives are derived from those
of the first theme, will be subsequently discussed in this section.
2. In the purely hierarchical
type of bipartite exposition the
second theme will be clearly identifiable and often song-like,
usually separated from the first part of the exposition by a
definite cadence and caesura. The first movement of Mozart's
G minor Symphony, K. 550, shows this type of exposition so
clearly that it is often cited as a paradigm of Classic sonata
form in music appreciation and "form and analysis" textbooks.
There are two fundamental types of contrasting song-themes in
sonata forms in the minor mode: those themes which can be
restated in tonic minor in the recapitulation and those which
cannot.

illustration occurs in the first movement of Koseluch's Sonata
in D minor, Op. 20/3: after the transition establishes the dominant of the mediant (F major) and a caesura occurs, an explosive passage begins in F minor after which the second theme
proper continues in F major; in the recapitulation this idea is
stated in tonic minor, after which the second theme is stated
in this same key and mode. The way was thus prepared for
Beethoven's beginning his second theme directly in mediant
minor in the first movement of his Piano Sonata Op. 13.
VI.

The Close of the Exposition

Crucial to the close of the exposition in sonata forms in the
minor mode is whether the concluding measures are a reinforcement of mediant tonality or whether there is a turning
back to tonic minor for the purpose of repeating the exposition.
Often this event is demarcated by first and second endings,
with the first ending leading back to tonic minor and the second
proceeding to the key of the opening of the development. When
the minor tonic is the eventual final goal of the exposition, the
closing themes are less distinctly pronounced and defined and
are more closely connected with second-theme material than
in expositions definitely closing in the mediant. The exception
occurs in borderline cases when there is a firm forte cadence
on the mediant, then a surprising shift to the dominant of tonic
minor, as in the first movement of Mozart's G minor Symphony,
K.550.
There is a strong correlation between the conclusion of the
exposition as a lead back to tonic minor and the "chamber" (as
opposed to the "symphonic") style of instrumental composition.
An examination of the endings of the expositions in 72 fast
sonata form movements in minor disclosed 53 with definite
and strong cadences in the mediant, 15 with lead backs to tonic
minor at the end, and four borderline cases comparable to the
first movement of Mozart's G minor Symphony cited above.
The only symphonic movements with expositions leading back
to tonic minor were the outer movements of Haydn's Symphony
no. 44 and Mozart's G minor symphony, K. 183, and the finale
of Francois Martin's Symphony Op. 4/2, composed no later
than 1751. The only similar piano sonata movements were the

incides with the stretto of this invention-like finale, whereas
in the finale of Haydn's Quartet Op. 42 the recapitulation coincides with the resumption of the fugue, but with the subject in
the bass and a new countersubject above it.
3. Some recapitulations do not begin with the first theme: the
section can begin with material associated in content and dynamics with the transition of the exposition (Haydn, Symphony
no. 44, IV; no. 78, I) or with the thematic order changed (EckBach, Sinfonia in E minor,
ardt, Sonata Op. 1/3, III; C.P.E.
Wq 177, I) or with the second part of the first theme (Haydn,
Quartet Op. 74/3, I). Though the first movement of Haydn's
Symphony no. 80 is ternary, it has two different recapitulations: a tonal one, considerably abridged, with a variant of
the first theme though beginning with the tonic minor chord in
first inversion, then a thematic recapitulation beginning with
the second theme in tonic major. An extreme example is the
cantata La Morte d'Alceste
sinfonia to Nicola Zingarelli's
(1789; MS in the library of the Naples Conservatory) in which
the severely contrapuntal opening in C minor is replaced in
the recapitulation by a brief, suave andante in C major.
II.

Transitions

The principal function of the transition in recapitulations is to
reinforce the feeling of the tonic. Often this function is achieved
by excursions into subdominant minor; in Galeazzi's words,
"it is necessary that the motive itself be conducted gradually
to the subdominant. . .and then make a cadence on the dominant". *27 This is especially true in semi-minor
recapitulations, where the second part of the recapitulation is in tonic

by the motive in the bass (mm. 175-87) to which a conclusion is
appended; this is the only fortissimo passage in the movement.
3. An expressive rather than a structural function is assumed
by a short, soft coda over a tonic pedal to end a movement in
place of the customary forte chords one tends to associate with
a definite conclusion.
The best known of such codas is the
conclusion of the first movement of Haydn's C minor Sonata,
but this effect occurs as early as the second movement of
Rutini's Sonata Op. 5/5. This type of coda is further associated with the "chamber" rather than the "symphonic" style; I
have not found it in any eighteenth-century
symphonies in minor, only in sonatas and chamber works (the first movement
of Haydn's Quartet Op. 17/4).

wildest harmonic excursions which utilizes both major and
minor forms of the flatted supertonic (Example 15). It would
be an extreme conjecture, however, to suppose that this passage (mm. 142-49) is in an axial relationship to the deceptive
progression in the exposition (mm. 42-43)which does not recur
in the recapitulation.
5. The coda can even be the arena of resolution of the harmonic and tonal conflicts of the entire movement, as in the
first movement of Mozart's curious D minor Quartet, K. 173.
Except for the reprise of the first theme, itself not tonally
very stable, and the first two measures of the transition, the
remainder of the lengthy recapitulation (54 mm. as compared
with 46 mm. of the exposition) is unstable; D minor, the tonic,

these two musical currents overlapped; such works as Haydn's
Op. 20/5 and Mozart's K.173 and K.421 Quartets are as Romantic as they are Classic, and in the finales of the first two
mentioned, even Baroque through their use of fugal techniques.
Yet the revitalization
of the minor mode in the instrumental
works of Clementi, Kozeluch, and Giovanni Viotti at the time
when Haydn and Mozart were retreating from minor, and
Haydn's borrowing of minor-mode elements into his slow introductions and slow movements in the major mode in his works
of the 1790's, are two salient elements in the shift from Classic
to Romantic in music.
The variety of the Classic-era
sonata form is most clearly
shown by the relatively few specimens, probably no more than
15% of the total number of sonata form movements composed
between 1740 and 1800, in the minor mode.
The critical portions of the sonata form movement in minor, were, in the expositions, the first themes; the transitional sections leading
from the original tonic to the new key (mediant major or, more
and the
rarely, dominant minor); the second theme-groups;
goals of the exposition itself: mediant major, dominant minor,
or a turnback to tonic minor. The recapitulations presented
even more choices for the composer: entire restatement or
curtailment of the first theme-group; a varied representation
of the transition; the treatment of the second theme in tonic
major, tonic minor, or with elements of both modes at the
close of the century; the establishment of subsidiary tonal axes
between exposition and recapitulation;
and the creation of a
coda that could include thematic material unheard since the

sonata form movements in the major mode, not only in transitional and development sections, but more crucially as interpolations within the second theme-groups.
For the composer, the minor mode opened a wider range of
choices and possibilities
than was present within the relatively
limited confines of the major mode. This is particularly evident in the works of the lesser-known composers of the Classic
period, for the routine superficiality of so many of their works
in the major mode was replaced by at least flashes of originality and even daring in their minor-mode compositions.
The flexibility of the minor mode permitted a continuity with
the legacy of the Baroque, so clearly seen in the themes outinterval or in contrapuntal sections.
lining a diminished-seventh
Similarly, the transition from Classic to Romantic is clearly
evident in the sonata form movements in minor not only in the

226
works of the main figures of the Classic period, but also in
those by Mozart's longer-lived
contemporaries such as E.A.
Forster, Clementi, Kozeluch, andDussek. All these composers
used the minor mode in their sonata form movements, subject
to certain conventions and principles, but their ingenious treatment of these limitations resulted in some of the most interesting works of the eighteenth century.
