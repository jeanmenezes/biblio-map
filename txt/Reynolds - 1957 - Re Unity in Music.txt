The last work on our list, Scriabine's,
exhibits in 166 measures
no less than thirty chromatic mediantal progressions
involving almost
the same number of triads, V7 chords and Vg chords. Of these protwelve are of the first degree; three, of the second; and fifgressions
teen, of the third.
The evidence given by these five movements is quite clear.
Wherever harmonic procedures play a major part in romantic music
the technique of chromatic mediants plays a significant role. With the
progress of Romanticism the use of this technique increased and at the
same time the more distant relationships
within this technique became
increasingly favored. On the other hand - and this is not clearly shown
true - contrasting of
by the examples here adduced but is nevertheless
sections of movements by means of chromatic mediants decreases.
Among our five selections
only the earliest ones, those by Beethoven
and Schubert, used this device.
It seems that the more complex the
internal harmonic texture of phrases became the less did composers
wish to complicate the external harmonic relationships from phrase to
phrase.
In closing it may be added that a similar analysis with respect to
modal mixtures, secondary dominants, and tension-created
chromaticisms would produce very similar results.

RE: UNITY IN MUSIC
By William H. Reynolds
An unfortunate tendency in teaching courses in harmony (and even
in more purely analytical studies) is that of confining analysis to a
mere harmonic dissection of a given piece of music.
The value of that
kind of study is limited at the most to practice in the recognition of
chords and chord progressions
as they appear in scores representing
different styles or textures and different media.
Such routine harmonic analysis can never be much else than dull;
and, once a student has gained facility in handling harmonic materials,
it is well-nigh meaningless.
A more mature approach, and one which
embodies considerably more interest for students, is the kind of analysis which attempts to determine the means of organization by which a
given musical composition is unified in an overall sense and at various
levels.
This kind of unity involves consideration of harmonic relationships, to be sure, but together with other unified elements such as
melodic line, rhythmic balance, and structural and formal details.
It is obvious that the beginning student in harmony will
scarcely
be able to produce analyses of complexworks which willbe in any sense
profoundly perceptive. It is important, however, that he be made aware
from the very outset of his musical studies that one aspect of music
cannot stand in a compartment by itself and render meaning while effecting little or no interaction with other structural elements of the
97

form. The real acquaintance with and understanding of a composer's
style and particular genius can never come from a one-sided investigation of his work; rather one becomes acquainted with a composer or
with a given composition by considering the means by which various
musical elements react with one another, producing unities which may
be in the large or in the small, in the tangible or relatively intangible,
but unities which are a part of the physical appearance and personality
of a musical work.
Even at the beginning level of musical study a student ought to be
expected to begin as soon as possible to point out the relation of harmonic details as a structural reinforcement
of form.
Further, the
student ought to be expected to perceive the linear destination of the
melodic material of a composition and to observe what relation exists
between the melodic material and the harmonic material,
including
such details as the treatment of areas of melodic climax.
Especially
important in a consideration of the melodic line and its relation to harmonic materials shouldbe the reduction of the melodic line to its strucform with attention given to the manner in which
tural, unembellished
the harmony provides reinforcement forthis skeletal line. Illustrations
of this will be discussed later. 2
Beyond this it is desirable to stimulate an awareness in the student's mind of some of the many less obvious means by which compositions may be given unity. As a student's musical intuition and perception grows, he should develop an increasing awareness of such techniques.
Each musical composition of the common-practice
style will involve the utilization of primarily similar musical details.
The varying
means and proportions of these musical details will determine in large
measure the uniqueness of a given work. The following comments are
offered only as suggestions which couldbe applied to individual attempts
at an over-all musical evaluation through analysis on the one hand,
through the reverse process of musical synthesis on the other.
A given melody should reveal certain implications.
A composition is not well unified if the harmonic implications
of its melody are
left unfulfilled.
The means of implication include the following: emphasis on a single tone by its placement on an accented beat, by its obvious repetition, or byits placement as a goal of stepwise or chromatic
linear movement; outlining a specific chord by leaps from strong to
weak areas of a measure or from one unaccented part of a measure to
another; outlining a chord by leaps which have been filled in with passing or other non-harmonic tones; emphasis on specific tones by placing
them at turning points of the melodic line (Example 1).
A striking unity in melodic writing can be achieved by the exploitation of a specific interval to which the melody is limitedthrough a
considerable
portion of its movement or which, although filled in by
stepwise movement, is pointed up nonetheless by a turning of the line
(Example 2).

This
has to do with the concept of a foreground area in which the entire
melody is involved from which it is possible to remove surface ornamentation and non-essential
movement, reducing the melody to a more
skeletal background in which the actual structural linear movement is
laid bare (Example 3).

Returning to the foreground of melodic writing, it is true also
that the consistent use of a particular kind of ornamentation within a
piece will create unity. Similarly, one of the surest means of achieving unity is the use of imitation or canon; likewise, the use of melodic,
harmonic, or rhythmic sequences is a very direct means of unity.
A very important role in the unification of a musical composition
is played by the harmony and the harmonic texture.
The employment
of a relatively continuous balance between consonance and dissonance,
related to what Sessions calls "dissonantal tension'3 must be accepted
as a most important principle. There must be an avoidance of any harmonic material which sounds out of context.
Context is, in this instance, the established norm of harmonic color for any given piece.
Thus the harmonic context of a Chopin Prelude is quite different from
that of a Bach Prelude.
Obviously, if any deviation from the norm is

Form is not to be
considered the application of an external plan or building scheme but
rather the logical outgrowth of the music itself.
This is simply to say
that the various elements of a composition must serve to reinforce the
over-all form of the composition.
A very important aspect of the reinforcement of form is the heirarchy of cadences4 which, in a sense,
punctuate the flow of the music.
The elements which constantly seek unification in a piece of music cannot be set down in any complete list, for each piece is a law unto
itself.
Each melody sets up its own particular implications which seek
realization and exploitation (or unification), and so also does each harmonic context and each rhythmic context.
4. The lesser cadences associated with phrase endings and the
stronger cadences associated with conclusions of musical sections with
the final cadence the most important of all would seem to form a kind
of heirarchy of cadences.
103

Besides making possible more meaningful musical analysis, the
study of unifying factors should produce an awareness which will help
the perceptive potential composer to approach at least a rudimentary
grasp of implications
present in his own creative work. It is true that
the problems of unity are of such subtlety as to defy verbalization,
and
it is all too possible that they may never be completely understood.
This seems all the more reason to introduce basic concepts which will
of this important subject at the earliest
bring about a consideration
possible moment in the study of music theory.

RE: A GENERAL THEORY OF MUSIC
By Leigh Gerdine
Perhaps we are now far enough along to posit a "general" theory
of music, a theory broad enough to fit into its statement such disparate
styles as those of Machaut and Schonberg and to make of the prevailing
harmonic idiom of the sixteenth century or the eighteenth century or
any century a "special" case. Theorists and acousticians have returned
again and again to the natural harmonic series to bulwark their hypotheses.
Though the system of equal temperament has confused this
issue somewhat, it is to the natural harmonic series that I would also
appeal.
1) First, to make a general statement: the history of musical
theory may be regarded as an exploration of harmonic possibilities
of
combinations of ever closer intervals occurring higher in the natural
harmonic series.
To the simple octave, in which men's and women's
or men's and boys' voices must naturally have sung, have been proadded the fifth and fourth, the major third and the minor
gressively
third, the major and minor sixths; the mathematical relation of vibration ratios acceptable to the ear has become thereby increasingly complex.
2) Second: the great upheaval in music which began about 1900
may be considered in the light of 1) above as an entirely inevitable step
in the admission of the seconds and sevenths,. both major and minor, as
"consonant" intervals.
The implications
of this statement are enormous. For one thing, it adopts a point of view in which the music of
Hindemith, Stravinsky, Bartok, Schonberg, and, indeed, every other
experimental composer of the twentieth century finds a place. Further,
it reduces the controversy which has divided atonalists from the defenders of tonality to somewhat the same status as the Brahms-Wagner
controversy of the nineteenth century.
In such a broad view as given in 1) above, the composition of music becomes a more or less systematic
exploration of structural relationships possible with the sound symbol of any given period.
More
important, of course, than the mere complexity of the sound symbol as
such is the logic with which it is used.
