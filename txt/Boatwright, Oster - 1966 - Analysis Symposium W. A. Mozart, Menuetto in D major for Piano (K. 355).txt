For the first symposiumwe have chosen a short piece by W.A.
Mozart, the Menuetto in D major for Piano (K. 355).
The
score is reproduced in full on the following two pages.
We had intended to publish three analyses, not two. Unfortunately, one of those invited to contribute was unable to meet
the deadline.
We say this to forestall the notion that our two
authors are to be viewed as adversaries
in any sense.

ANALYSIS

SYMPOSIUM

HOWARD BOATWRIGHT
I. Mozart's remarkable little Menuetto (K. V. 355, revised by
Einstein to 594a and dated 1790) is one of those works which

to (and is sometimes printed next to)the well-known chromatic
Gigue (K. V. 574) which Mozart wrote in the album of the Leipzig court organist, Engel, after his visit to Berlin and Leipzig
in the spring of 1789. Perhaps it is not far-fetched to assume
that contact with previously unknown works of J. S. Bach in
Leipzig, as wellas the tasks of orchestrating Handel's Messiah
Feast
(1789), and Ode for St. Cecilia's Day and Alexander's
(1790), stimulated Mozart not only to intensified contrapuntal
effort in his last works, but also to a style of harmony sometimes closer to baroque "affect" than to classical
clarity.
Looked at from another angle, Mozart's late chromaticism may
appear to be an anticipation of romantic (or even later) har-

Beginning with bar 5, the strong (arsis) bars have a dissonance, which enhances the effect of resolution in the weak bars.
In bars 5, 7 and 9, this dissonance is the augmented triad, in
which the crucial tone (always in the tenor) enters without simproducing the maximum shock for

But the meter is ignored after the third beat of bar 20, when
the motive is treated sequentially in diminution, leading to a
climax on the dominant, prior to dissolution into running figures and a return to the A strain:

So pregnant are the opening measures of the Menuetto that significant issue is brought forth even from the three eighth-notes
which serve as an upbeat link to bar 5. The same melodic
figure occurs in the same metrical position in bars 6 and 8
(and in the return, at bars 34 and 36):

garded simply as a lower neighbor at the half-step of the tone
which follows it. The basic harmony for each bar, according
to this approach, is a sixth chord. Such an interpretation leads
to resolutions of the preceding dominants as shown in Example
1.
To approach the problem in still another way, we may take the
unfigured bass and melody as a starting point, and assume that
each augmented triad is a true altered chord, each having a
raised fifth. If such were the case, the preceding dominants
would then have the following resolutions shown in Example 2,
substituting unaltered chords for altered ones. If we consider
the two sets of resolutions given in Examples 1 and 2, the more
convincing ones are Examples lc and 2a and b.
It now becomes clear that in spite of the sequential nature of
the passage, bars 5-9, each augmented chord has a different
melodic origin and a different harmonic function. Therefore,

Mozart, then, seems to have been simply to have the same
sonority, an augmented triad, on the first beat of every other
bar in the passage. Or from the motivic point of view, to have
the three-note chromatic motive in the tenor part in every other
bar. Or perhaps Mozart may have had one of these intentions,
and the other formation may have been one of those lucky accidents which Stravinsky admits to be so important in composition, if the composer is shrewd enough to know how to seize
upon them and to weave them into the fabric so that the intentional and the accidental can no longer be distinguished from
each other (see Poetics of Music, pp. 53-55).

and, following this idea, the editors of Kbchel 6 gave it still
another number, 5 76b. But there is no real basis for Einstein's
assumption, excepting the identity of key. And it appears highly
unlikely that Mozart would have included a short minuet without a trio in a sonata of the length of the D major K. 576.
nor its sudden dissonances,
Neither the Minuet's chromaticism,
nor certain contrapuntal devices would of necessity point to a
late period in Mozart's work. All of these features appear in
some of his much earlier compositions.
And the strange diversity of texture seems to deny the possibility that the piece was
written in the vicinity of masterworks
such as the D major
sonata or the D major quartet K. 575. At first glance, most
of its middle section with the running sixteenths seems out of

features of this kind which led Siegmund-Schultze
to assume
that the piece was written somewhat earlier than 1790. *1
Siegmund-Schultze also says that Mozart seems to have tried
"special minuet studies" in K. 355 and mentions that Mozart,
at that time (1790), "experimented" with other forms as well,
for instance with the gigue (K. 574) and particularly the rondo.
At least as far as our Minuet is concerned, I think that SiegmundSchultze hit the nail on the head when he spoke of "minuet studies" and Mozart's "experimenting".
The piece is certainly a
genuine Mozart, and in many ways it is of great beauty. But
it also contains a few compositional weaknesses not usually to
be found in Mozart. If the piece really is a "study", then we
are provided with an explanation for its occasional imperfections and are able to see them in their proper light. It would
also explain why Mozart did not complete the composition.
I
even wonder whether the last twelve measures of the main part
were written by Mozart himself. I shall deal with this question
later on.
In order to make clear what I mean by "weaknesses",
I should

tone, either coming from al in m. 16, or else from an al implied on the first beat, as shown in Example 6d. It then becomes apparent that the left hand repeats in smaller note values

One could almost call this a canon by diminution.

coinciding of the closures results in the rather "unpleasant"

section and the beginning of the reprise.
Here we had found
the chromatically descending third-progression
c#l-A which
extends the dominant into the reprise, and which harks back
to the beginning of the middle section.
These features are
astounding in themselves, but Mozart does even more: he adds
the chordal thirds d#l and c#l to the descending line. Thus,
in mm. 29-30, the

devices:
"comes" enters at the distance of a quarter beat; in the second,
which opens the middle section, after two beats; and in the last
one, in the first two bars of the third section, simultaneously
with the "dux".
The basic voice-leading
progression of mm. 28-30 was shown
in Example 1. We should like to leave it to the reader to find
between
further harmonic, rhythmic, and tone-similarities
mm. 29-30 and mm. 17-20. Even the imitative role which the
bass plays in both cases contributes in bringing the two passages into the closest relationship to each other. At the same
time, what a contrast in character between the harsh dissonances of mm. 17ff and the "mancando" and "dolce" later on!
Indeed, the beginning of the reprise is probably the most inthe most beautiful place in the

It is most difficult to determine the inner meaning of mm. 510. The pattern of mm. 5-6 is repeated literally in mm. 7-8
and again in mm. 9-10. This is certainly an unusual thing to
do, especially when the repeated pattern is as complex as it is

literal to the point that they reproduce the exact intervallic
relationship set forth in mm. 5-6, without the slightest adjustment being made for the sake of harmony or for other considerations.
This accounts for the strange bass tones c0 and
f in mm. 7 and 9. Or, to express it differently, since m. 5
started with a B minor sixth chord, m. 7 had to begin with an
A minor, and m. 9 with a D minor sixth chord.
The augmented fifths at the beginning of each group are not part

The nature of augmented fifths is alWhen we keep

worthy of a master of the rank of Mozart. *4

D minor-major (see Example 3).
The chromatic quarter notes of the left hand m. 5 show a certain resemblance to the bass of mm. 1-2. The chromatically
descending broken thirds of m. 6 seem to be related to the
right hand m. 2. And the right hand from m. 9 on to the e2 in
m. 11 shows a close similarity to certain features of mm. 1-4.
The similarity becomes still closer when we realize that the
inner voice reproduces almost exactly the bass of the beginning;
even d-G-Aof mm. 3-4 appears, nowmodifiedto dl-g#-a.
And
the bass moves in parallel tenths with the top voice, as if the
intention were to reproduce even the parallel thirds of the beginning. Indeed, the whole passage seems to represent a free
repetition of mm. 1-4 (without the embellishing eighths of m. 3),
with bass and inner voice exchanged. Such a similarity cannot
be accidental - not in Mozart.
But all the features we have discussed so far are only isolated

The only exceptions are to be found in the recapitulations of a few early piano
sonatas. It would go beyond the scope of this discussion to show in what respects
the situation in these recapitulations differs from that in the Minuet.
