Leonard Ratner:

For the Layman14

Music theory for the layman is a matter which raises a number
of general questions.
At the very outset we should determine the
following:
1. Who is the layman?
2. What kind of music theory is appropriate for him?
3. In what way may he be taught music theory?
Here, we consider the student in a liberal arts college as the layman in question.
This limits the discussion
since we are excluding
there are advanmany other kinds of musical laymen; nevertheless,
tages in centering our attention upon such students. The machinery for
teaching them is set up; classrooms,
equipment, units, requirements these all helpto organize the situation for a direct and sustained learning effort. We can also rely upon student interest and curiosity about
music to provide motivation for learning.

Beethoven's Fifth Symphony has a dual aspect: it is a point of departure,
of course, for the last movement; onthe other hand, it is a tremendously dramatic point of arrival leading away from the scherzo; it is prepared by a very long period of gradually rising pitch, increasing
strength of sound and amount of sound, and brightening color of sound.
The clarity and emphasis of this point of arrival are attheir maximum.
On the other hand, there is but a partial sense of finality.
This is no
ending but a beginning of something new. Conversely, if we take a song

level of emphasis is about equal for each of these points of arrival,
relatively light, with the exception of the last, which seems stronger
by virtue of its greater implied length. The points of arrival in this
song are principally points of punctuation or articulation; the point of
arrival in the Beethoven symphony acts as a goal foreshadowed long
before its actual appearance.
Still another example: the pauses at the beginning of the Prelude
to Tristan are not clear, emphatic, nor are they byany means final.
In each phase of movement the music trails off; it evaporates,
leaving
us suspended in mid-air, figuratively speaking.
We can link movement and arrival quite closely in our analysis.

off the exposition and development sections of a classic sonata-form
follow broad and sweeping phases of movement.
The steady, purposeful movement with few but decisive points of arrival in a baroque fugue
or concerto might be contrasted to the tentative quality of movement
and indecisive cesuras at the beginning of Wagner's Tristan.
Listening for points of arrival has an interesting and valuable
effect for the student. As he anticipates these points he becomes quite

sounds and textures, the fluctuation of qualities of movement, the deHe can then begin to appreciate the structure of

the third movement of Beethoven's C-minor Symphony. Here,
the single-minded,
direct, hammerrepetition underscores
like quality of the theme, with its heavy sense of movement
and its great strength of sound. We can also point to the
binding effect of repetition when it follows some variation or
contrast in ABAB, ABCB, or other formal arrangements.
The opening movement of the C-minor Symphony of Beethoven
provides an excellent example of the variation of a basic
motive; motives are gathered here into a steadily rising line
that reaches a climax at its apex. We can get a very dramatic idea of the effect of contrast at the opening oftheFinale
of Mozart's G-minor Symphony. Certainly the extreme contrast of the "rocket" motive with its levelled-off
counterstatement contributes measurably to the electrifying quality
of this piece.
Having drawn attention of the listener to the importance of
melodic motives and to their mutual relationships,
we can
illustrate in an extended movement, such as the first movement of Mozart's Quintet in Eb major (K. 614) how motives
are stated, joined, separated,
and treated in
re-aligned,
different contexts.
In all these examples, and in whatever
others may be used, we can show how melodic motives have
character, musical personality, and provide clues as to the
nature of the composition of which they form the structural
units.
4.

At this point, we may venture cautiously into the matter of
melodic intervals.
Circumstances
limit us very much here;
however, certain salient aspects of melodic interval structure can be directly meaningful.
Principal among these is
the idea of size.
Conjunct and disjunct melodic intervals
create markedly different impressions.
Melodies built principally from one of these two types will receive something
of their character from the conjunct or disjunct structure.
The smoothness of plainsong or the Hymn to Joy from Beethoven's Ninth Symphony depends entirely upon stepwise
melodic action.
The boldness we note at the beginning of
Mozart's Haffner Symphony or Brahms' Third Symphony
arises from the decisive leaps which line out these themes.
Conjunct versus disjunct intervallic structure is a factor in
the stylistic difference between the opening movements of

The vigorous strokes of the Blue Danube
Waltz, the light, clockwork action in the first movement of
Bach's Brandenburg Concerto No. 2, the total absence of a
palpable beat in the first measures of Wagner's Tristanthese represent ways of using the beat or of avoiding it for
special purposes of musical communication.

The lay listener can appreciate the groupings of beats or

rhythmic regularity or balance, to show how it is established
by repeated metric patterns; we can then show how effective
a disturbance of regularity can be. I should like to mention
two examples. In the first movement of his EroicaSymphony,
Beethoven establishes
a rather quick triple meter.
At the
25th measure, he suddenly compresses
the metric group to
duple, throwing the rhythmic action out of joint, into a higher
gear; before this imbalance is adjusted, we hear an entire
series of fluctuating metric groups, twos, threes, and misplaced threes; this all culminates in a tremendous drive to
a dramatic point of arrival.
In the opening movement of
Stravinsky's L'Histoire du Soldat, two specific metric levels
are established.
There is a basic duple meter given out by
the string bass, a kind of "oompah" figure. Above this steady
movement, we hear figures involving many kinds of metric
grouping.
By focussing in turn upon each element in this
rhythmic plan, we can appreciate the wonderful effect that
arises from the play of rhythmic balance and imbalance.

It seems to me that any more specific or detailed explanation of
meter or rhythm would depend upon the time available and the aptitude
of the class.
In any case, I think that these would have to be related to
the underlying aspects of musical rhythm, the idea of a beat or pulse,
the idea of metric groupings, and the play of rhythmic balance and imIt is these that the layman can use directly in his listening.

Another meaningful aspect of musical action is texture.
This involves the action of the component parts. Although we usually classify
texture as being homophonic or polyphonic, there is a wide range of
