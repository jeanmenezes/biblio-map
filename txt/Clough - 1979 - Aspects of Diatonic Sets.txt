ASPECTS OF DIATONIC SETS

John Clough

Since Forte's seminal work of 1964,1 the literature dealing with
what may be loosely describedas the theory of pitch class(pc) sets has
grown steadily. As was natural, given the direction of Forte's work,
most of this literaturehas been concernedwith 12-pc set theory and its
applicationsin the analysis of "atonal"works. Although the possibility
of an appropriately shaped pc set theory for the diatonic case was
noticed early on, the subject received no significantattention in the
literature until Regener'sbrief treatment in his review of Forte's later
work.2 Space is also devoted to the topic of diatonic sets in at least one
recent textbook,3 a fact which may indicate(or bringabout) increasing
awarenessof it on the part of the theoreticalcommunity.
The present article develops diatonic pc set theory more fully,
offering the necessary apparatus of abstractions, followed by two
applicationsin musicalanalysis.4
Theoryof Diatonic pc Sets
Diatonic ChordTypes
As Regenerhas pointed out, the sevendiatonic note classesA, B, C,
.. .,G, irrespectiveof inflection by sharpsand flats, may be taken as
45

the universal set and subjected to the same formalism as the twelve
chromaticpc's.5 Thus [A, C, E], [A, C-sharp, and [A, C-flat, E], are
E],
all equivalent collections in such a diatonic world, in the sameway that
are
[A, C, E], [A, B-sharp,E], and [A, D-double-flat,E], equivalentin the
12-pcworld.
To regardC, C-sharp,and C-flat, as membersof the same note class
may seem to be counterintuitive. It implies that we recognize, for
example, infinitely many "triads"which are different in structurewith
respect to the 12-pc universe, as equivalent structures within the
diatonic universe.We can circumventthis problem for the moment by
observingthat the diatonic universeof seven pc's may be constructedin
variousother ways which permitapplicationof the same formalism.For
example,we may simply stipulatethat the universeconsistsof the seven
pc's of any chosen major scale. In this case we still admit triads of
"different" structure(major, minor, diminished), but their structural
equivalenceis arguablewith referenceto a familiarmusicalobject. The
important point is that the formalism applies indifferently to any
universeof seven elementswhich can be cyclically ordered.The manner
in which actual soundedor notated pitches may be legitimatelyreduced
to seven elements of cyclic structure(and indeed whetherthey may be
so reduced) is an analyticalquestion which must be answered,for any
particularobject of study, before the theory of sets here developed can
be applied.
In keeping with the above, I make no constraintsat this juncture on
the rules for formation of the diatonic universe,beyond the condition
that it be isomorphicto the set of integers0, 1, 2, ... , 6, modulo 7.
For the sake of convenienceand simplicityin constructingillustrations,
however, I shall assume in the following discussion that the integers
representthe notes of the C majorscale, with C = 0.
Following Lewin, I use the term intervalhere to mean the "directed
distance from one pc to another," measuredin an upwarddirection.6
Interval thus pertainsto an ordered pair of pc's: the intervalfrom C to
C is zero; that from C to D is 1; from C to E is 2;. ..; from C to B is 6.
Or-numerically-from 0 to 0 is 0, from 0 to 1 is 1, etc. And, of course,
from 6 to 0 is 1, from 6 to 1 is 2, etc.
Following Regener, I use the term chord to mean the interval
structureof a set of pc's or any of its transpositions.The structureis
indicated by a sequence of numbers, always adding to seven in the
diatonic case, listing the intervalsbetween successivepc's, given all pc's
arrangedin ascendingorder within an octave, with the first pc repeated
at the end. Thus the set [C, E, G], or [0, 2,4], forms the chord (223).
(The chord notation is alwaysenclosed in parentheses.)Since chord, by
definition, refers to an unordered set, the rotations of (223), namely
(232) and (322), designate the same chord as (223). (A rotation
46

is constructed by transposingthe first intervalof the notation to the
end of the sequence. Additional rotations are constructedby repeating
this operation. Thus the number of distinct rotations of a chord of n
pc's is less than or equal to n.)7
The normal form of a chord (or, more precisely, of a chord notation), for which Regenersuggests(and I adopt) the term intervalnormal
form (INF), is evidently still an unsettled matter. Departinghere from
Regener, I choose as the INF that rotation having the largest last
interval,and in cases where that criteriondoes not yield a unique INF,
the rotation havingalso the smallest first interval(and if a uniqueINF
is still not found, the smallestsecond interval,and third interval,etc., as
necessary to determine a unique INF).8 In all that follows, the INF
notation for chords will be used, except where explicitly stated otherwise.
By intervalclass I shallmean a complementarypairof intervalsi and
j such that i = 7 -j. There are thus three intervalclassesin the diatonic
universe(excluding zero):
icl (1-6, mod 7) - traditional2nds and 7ths
ic2 (2=5, mod 7) - traditional3rds and 6ths
ic3 (3=4, mod 7) - traditional4ths and Sths
The intervalvector is thus a three-digitregister.It is enclosed in square
brackets,without internal commas(to distinguishit from a pc set). For
example,(223), the triad,has the intervalvector [O2 1].
Likethe questionof which kinds of pitch equivalenceare appropriate
in the construction of a diatonic universe,the question of inversional
equivalence is essentially music-analytical;the formalism is readily
applicablewhether or not inversionis a recognizedoperation. For the
diatonic case, there is no great differencebetween the chord repertoire
generated with inversionalequivalence and that generatedwithout it:
there are just four diatonic chords whose inversions differ from the
original chord, namely (124) and its complement (2113), and their
inversions(214) and (1123). All of these are treated as distinct chords
in the enumerationto follow.
(To notate the inversionof a chord, simply reversethe sequenceof
intervals. For example, (124) inverted is (421), the INF of which is
(214), a different chord; (223) inverted is (322), the INF of which is
again(223), the same chord.)
With few exceptions, diatonic chords can be generated by superimposition of a single interval. The exceptional cases are the aforementioned (124) and its inversion(214), which are all-interval
trichords
of content [1 1 1], and their complements,of content [2 2 2].
Table 1 shows the complete rosterof diatonic chordsof two through
five pc's, with interval vectors and generators.Complementarychord
pairs are placed opposite one anotheron the sameline. Here and in the

following tables, an abstract example of each pc set is shown on the
staff-abstract in the sense that, since no clef is given, the notes display
the normal form of the set without referenceto specific pc's. In Table
1, sets are also shown in "clock" notation: dots on the circumference
of a larger circle represent pc's (clockwise is "up"). Circled dots
indicate, by their relativelocations, the structureof a chord. A heavy
circlearounda dot indicatesa pc from which the INF can be counted in
a clockwise direction.
OrderedTrichords
As shown in Table 2, each of the five unordereddiatonic trichords
corresponds to six distinct ordered paris of intervals. These can be
generated simply by writing down an ordered set of three pc's correspondingto each of the five trichords,permutingthe orderof the pc's,
and computing the resulting pairs of intervals.9 An alternate way of
generatingthe 30 orderedtrichordsis to note the 6 X 6 = 36 ordered
pairs of intervals(the members of an ordered pair may be identical).
Six of these pairswill producea redundantthird pc. Thereforewe have
again(6 X 6) - 6 = 30 orderedtrichordsby this reckoning.
OrderedSourceTrichords
Applying the classical operators T, I, R, RI, over the 30 ordered
trichords, reduces this collection to nine ordered source trichords.
Labelled a through i, these source trichords correspond to the five
unorderedtrichordsand to the 30 orderedtrichordsas shown in Table
2 and summarized Table 3.
in
TrichordChains
Consider a succession of pc's in which all of the ordered trichords
beginning in odd order positions are equivalent (it follows that all
of the ordered trichords beginning in even order positions are also
equivalent). Such a successionwill be known here as a trichordchain.
As shown in Table 4, each of the nine ordered source trichords can
generate two distinct chains (one for the P or RI form, and one for the
I or R form). Alternatively,we can think of each chain as characterized
by an unordered pair of (possibly identical) intervals(excluding zero)
and compute 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 21. However, three pairs

produce a redundantthird pc. There are therefore21 - 3 = 18 distinct
trichordchainsby this reckoningalso.
In the case of Table 4, it is particularlynecessaryto rememberthat
the given staff notation models only one of many possible realiLations
which represent each chain of pc's. Furthermore,Table 4 gives no
indication of the complete "cycle" of each chain (the number of pc's
before the entire chain begins to repeat). For those chains havingtwo

equal intervalsin the generatingpair, the complete cycle is seven pc's;
for other chainsit is 14 pc's.
Obviously, trichord chains may also be conceived as successionsof
equivalent ordered dichords, articulatedby equal intervals,or (as suggested above) as repetitions of a particular interval pair. Certain
registral deployments of pc's may bring about strong tetrachordal
groupings,as reflected in the notation of severalchainsin Table 4. Consider, for example, chain h as an incipient model of the opening
measures of Brahms's Fourth Symphony. (The reader will have no
difficulty findingother such models in Table 4.)
AnalyticalApplications
A strikingfeatureof the repertoireof diatonic chordsis its smallness.
If transpositional but not inversional equivalence is recognized, it
consists of just 20 chords (16 as representedin Table 1, plus one chord
each of zero, one, six, and seven pc's). By comparison, the 12-pc
repertoireis bewilderinglylarge-352 chords!10
This compactness of vocabulary carries with it the potential for
relativelysimple cognitiveprocessing.To the Westernmusician,an aural
or visualscanning the diatonic chord repertoireis a perusalof familiar
of
objects. We have heard and seen them all countless times; we know
them; we are therefore preparedto attribute a variety of significations
to them. Curiously,however, there is in traditionalanalysisan unyielding disparitybetween two classesof diatonic trichordsand tetrachords:
tertianchordsand scale segmentsmay have structuralsignificance,while
others may not.
Diatonic chords which are neither tertian nor scale segmentsare, of
course, thoroughly explored in classical theory. But they are understood only in their local significanceas they relate to tertian chords
through a repertoireof linear types, i.e., passing tone, appoggiatura,
etc. While not disavowingthe contrapuntaland decorative functions
of such chords, I suggest that they also serve structuralfunctions at
variouslevels, and offer two studiesbelow in supportof this claim.
Mozart's
Jupiter Symphony, first movement
When i is substituted for 7 in V7, the tetrachord(1213) results,as
shown in Example 1. This ubiquitous sonority, familiar to all tonal
musicians in its manifold contrapuntalcontexts, is so powerful in its
suggestionof V -I polarity that, even when presentedcompletely out of
context, it tends to be felt as a tonal phenomenon.1 The opening
measuresof Mozart'sJupiter Symphony display horizontalprojections
of this tetrachord, set against a temporal hierarchy of I and V in
unusualways.

In the analysisgiven in Example 2, the familiarsymmetricalpattern
I V/V I appearsat level 2 in mm. 1-8. However,textural, dynamic,and
linear factors articulate the beginningsof mm. 1, 5, and 9, so that at
level 1 the onset of V occurs not in m. 3, but in m. 5, equispaced
between m. 1 and m. 9. In mm. 3-4 and 7-8, there are elaborationsof
V andI, respectively(level 3 in Example 1); it is here that the horizontal
projectionsof (1213) are found, to which we come presently.
It is tempting to read the melody of mm. 7-8 as a transpositionof
mm. 3-4 with G-F substitutedfor E-D (Example 3). There is a better
explanation,however:in Example4 a generativescheme for the melody
is proposed. The initial tonic and dominant of mm. 1-2 and 5-6,
announced in octaves, are each continued by a harmonized encirclement figure (Example 4a). The encirclementfigures are then linked as
shown by the small brackets in Example 4b, the tail dyad of the first
figure being interpolated before the second figure, and the head dyad
of the second figure being interpolated after the first figure. This
generatesall of the melodic pitches of mm. 3-4 and 7-8 in the correct
order.As shown by the largebracketsof Example4b, pitches 3 through
6 are identicalto pitches 7 through 10.
As a result of this linking process, the originalencirclementfigures
are located at relatively different temporal positions within their
respective two-measuretime spans. Interestingly,however, both occur
within the V-I segmentsof the level 3 elaborationsover the samebass
pitches, and, collectively, they exhaust the traditional repertoire of
possible two against one, strong-to-weakcontrapuntalconfigurations
with upper voice in stepwise descent against stationary lower voice
(Example 5).
We are now ready to observethe instancesof the (1213) tetrachord.
In mm. 3-4, the tetrachord [C, D, F, G] is the initial verticality. A
tetrachord of identical pc content is also projectedby the attacks on
each beat of the melody in those measures(Example6).
As the slurs in Example 4b suggest,the 12 pitches of mm. 3-4 and
7-8 exhibit 4 + 2/2 + 4 symmetry. This is shown more clearly in
Example 7. Deleting the rhythmicallyweak notes of the encirclement
figures,we obtain the series of eight pitches in Example 8, which now
contains the strong notes of the encirclementfigures(tetrachordA of
Example 8) together with the "linking"dyads (tetrachord B). Tetrachords C andD arewholly within mm. 3-4 and 7-8, respectively.All of
these four tetrachords are of structure (1213) and, because of the
generationprocess, we have the identities of pc content (though not of
order)A = D and B = C. (Note that in this context, tetrachordsC and
D are isolated by a different set of criteriathan those exercisedfor the
isolation of the melodic [C, D, F, G] in the case of Example6.)
(If only the initial pitch of each weak-strongdyad is considered,

then mm. 3-4 and 7-8 reduce to two trichords of structure (133)
but, significantly,it
[Example 9]. This resultis less rich in relationships,
still contains chordswhich are non-tertianand non-scale-segment.)
My claim here is that, while an explanation of horizontal (1213)
tetrachordsin mm. 1-8 partlyin terms of tertian structuresis pertinent
(indeed quite apparent in the [C, D, F, G] of mm. 3-4, as explained
above), the variousmanifestationsof (1213) argue for the conception
of that chord's role as truly structuralwithin the context of this time
span.
Beethoven'sBagatelle,Opus 119/1
The design of this Bagatelle(the complete score is given in Example
10) may be understoodas the initialization,interruption,resumption,
development, and completion of a double trichord chain based on the
intervalpair 4 1. That pairis associatedwith the non-tertian,non-scalesegment (124) trichord and its inversion(214) (see Table 4, item e).12
Mm. 1-4 initialize the pattern of parallelthirdsdescendingthroughthe
intervalof a fourth, followed by a transpositionof that materialat the
lowerthird. This much is shown in Example 1la and, with passingtones
deleted, in Example lb. As indicatedby the arrowin Example lla,
the upper voice of the second of these two descentsimitates the lower
voice of the first descent at the upperoctave. This suggestsan ordering
of the fourth descents as in Example lc, with the middle one as a
common cell between the two voices, all of which projects a short
trichordchainwith the intervalseries4 1 4 1 4.
This short chain already contains a repetition of the initial pc (D).
Since, however,the chainhas a complete cycle of 14 pc's (Example 12),
repetition of the pc seriesis not threatenedat this point.
of
The remainder the first section (mm. 5-16) producesrestatements
of the same chain segment but no continuation. Example 13 presents
mm. 5-8 stripped of several embellishing notes and shows melodic
relationshipsof those measuresin correspondenceto mm. 1-4. Here a
different fourth descent (D to A, labelled cell a in Example 13) is
treated imitatively, and the accompanyingmaterial(cell b) completes
the inverted counterpoint of mm. 5-6. The upper voice of mm. 6-8
constitutes a compressed restatement of mm. 1-4, upper voice, set
againsta bass configuredsimilarlyto cell b. Mm. 9-16 repeatmm. 1-8,
except for the tonic cadencein m. 16.
The impressiveE-flat of m. 17 continuesthe trichordchain. It is the
next member of the series establishedin mm. 1-4 (Example 1lc), and
by supplyingthe lower third of the isolated G of m. 16, continuesthe
pattern of parallelthirds (Example 14, mm. 1-17). Mm. 17-32 may be
as
regarded a prolongationof [E-flat,G].

section in mm. 37-52, and the first coda in mm. 53-65, to which we
return presently, all forego continuation of the trichord chain. That
function is reserved for the second coda, mm. 66-74. These measures
contain a version of mm. 1-4, transposed as though to C minor, but
perceived as a plagal cadence. Continuing the trichord chain, they recall
the long-abandoned [E-flat, G] of mm. 17-32, and add three more
thirds in parallel motion, concluding on [G, B] (Example 14, mm. 6674).
The figural material of the first coda (mm. 53-65) may now be
understood as a development of the thirds of mm. 3-4 and 68-69, as
indicated in Example 14. In re-asserting the [G, B-flat] and [D, F-sharp]
of mm. 3-4, and isolating the G as in m. 16, mm. 61-65 prepare the
return of [E-flat, G] in m. 66, in similar fashion to the preparation of its
original appearance in m. 17.
Example 15, a reduction of Example 14, presents a summary of the
work as a double trichord chain. Note the phase relationship between
the two chains: the lower voice "leads" and the upper voice "follows"
by a "time" interval of two notes. This characteristic is manifest
contrapuntally in the imitation in mm. 1-4, and harmonically in the
functional scheme shown in Example 15.

would be possible to adopt the conventionof droppingthe last intervalfrom

retain them all in the notation. This practice has the added advantage of
facilitating visualization of rotations.
The algorithm with which Regener computes the INF ("On Allen Forte's
Theory of Chords," pp. 196-197) is simpler than that for computing the INF
which corresponds to pc normal form. Regener's INF also permits a more
meaningful lexical ordering of INF's. Despite these advantages, I prefer the
INF given here, because of its correspondence to what would seem to be the
intuitive normal form of a chord in pc notation.
Where the size N of the universe is non-prime, the permutations will not
necessarily represent distinct ordered trichords (or tetrachords, etc.). For
example, if N = 6, the six permutations of the trichord [0, 2, 4] represent
only two distinct ordered trichords, corresponding to the ordered interval
pairs 2 2 and 4 4.

Here and in the following discussion we take the C major scale as the diatonic
universe. Note that the diatonic tetrachord (1213) may correspond to any
one of the following 12-pc chords: (1416), (1425), (2325), and (2415), all of
which are strong in tonal suggestion. (We are concerned only with (2325) in
the present context.)
As several analysts have pointed out, the melodic style of Beethoven is
characterized by the prevalence of these trichords, and sequences based upon
them. A recent exploration along these lines is Walter Schenkman's "The
Tyranny of the Formula in Beethoven," College Music Symposium, XVIII
(1978), 158-74.
