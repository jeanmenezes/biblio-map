composition,
some principles
which may serve to make his occupation
understandable.
There are four obvious external
elements
that we can start with.
There is the player himself,
who is a complex
and busy human being.
There is his instrument
(let us say a piano) on which he is playing.
There is the score
that was set down by the composer.
And there is
the audience for whom he is playing.
The score,
the player's

the relative speed at which the tones
pattern of metrical relationships,
must follow each other, measured on the scale of a regular underlying
pulse. The speed of that underlying pulse a composer may indicate as
a rate on the metronome.
However, there may be some indications as
to when the underlying pulse should speed up, or when it should slow
down; and when this is to happen, the amount of speeding up, or the
amount of slowing down, cannot be indicated exactly.
The composer
can indicate in general whenthe music shouldbe loud andwhen it should
be soft, but it is not possible for him to say precisely how loud or soft;
nor is it possible for him to indicate, if the music is to grow louder,
just how much louder it grows, and at what rate of increase; nor, when
it is to grow softer, just how much softer, or at what rate of decrease.

that a composer can write into the score that will give precisely what
the dynamic proportions should be although this question is important
to the effect of sonority.
Also in the specifications
of the score there is one class of terms
which do not refer at all to the objective and measurable characteristics of the sound event, such as loudness and duration, but to the emotional effect on the listener.
Such terms are "maestoso'' "amoroso"'
and "scherzando!' Terms like these do not constitute a direction to the
player in the sense that the rest of the score does. They are rather a
kind of test to be used byhim to determine whether he has appropriately gauged the elements which, because of the limited communicative
power of the score, the composer could not make specific.
At best, the specifications
of the score are meagre and limited,
and there is much required in the performance of a composition that
the performer must judge for himself.
The how loud, and how soft,
how fast, how slow; the how much louder, how much softer, the how
much faster, how much slower; and the balance between simultaneous
elements that determines
sonority - these we may call the plastic
characteristics
of music in performance.
These are the aspects of
performance which depend on the judgment of the player, matters in
which he must make up his own mind fromthe sparse clues a composer
can give him. It is in this area of the plastic that a player exercises
his art of performance.
Dynamic proportions and rhythmic subtleties
- these must be the contribution of the player to the composition as he
performs it..
It is all-important how he derives his judgments on these matters.
But before we go into this question, let us first consider the listener.

He can give emphasis to certain characteristics
of the composition above others and so regulate the degree of significance that is attributed to each part in the impression of the whole. He
can prevent the listener from attributing more than fitting importance
to any minor event in the whole, by treating it casually.
And he can
make certain that the listener does not miss the events which are most
significant in the work, by giving them stress and emphasis.
He can do all this because, having worked out his conception of

and by observing his own attention-processes
as affected by his own
performance, he can prettywell know how the listener is being affected.
He holds the attention of the listener intent upon a musical line by making sure that his own attention is intently held. He guarantees the continuity and unity of a phrase or progress inthe listener's mind by making sure of it in his own. He arouses expectation in the listener by
himself actively expecting the significant event and seeing to it that the
crux of the occurrence is not anticipated.
He assures recall of a previous musical statement by reference to its evocation in his own consciousness

Because he has such power over the mind of the listener through

to conceal the true nature of a composition as it is for him to reveal it.

student is kept with his eyes and attention riveted to the rulebook, instead of having it pointed out to him that the significance of things like
parallel fifths is that they are dynamite, and then letting him study how
the great composers handled dynamite.
It seems to me that the way to
study and understand the manipulation of musical forces is to look
directly over the shoulders of the real experts, the composers.

to some extent a different theory. And the way to learn this is not by
looking at the rulebook all the time but by looking at compositions.
Otherwise the rules stand like the laws of the Medes and the Persians
in the student's mind, and it may be years, if ever, before he opens
his eyes one day to the truth of the music and finds that the rules are
not anywhere near so true as all that. Dealing with real music is a

It does not profit the performer that he is able to identify a certain relationship between voices as a major seventh unless he goes on
to see its function not only as a dissonance arising from suspension,
but also as tightening up the finality of a cadence with a structural and
dramatic function in the progress of the whole work. Nor is it sufficient for him to be able to label a harmonic combination as dominant
unless he goes beyond that to see its place in a harmonic progression
that leads the music onwards and brings it to the attainment of some
overall structural and dramatic purpose.
This is where he must begin as a performer, but it is only his starting point. He must go on

too great a change and result in undue weight being given to this lesser
event in the context of more important events of greater duration? Always he has to look at the context, and always atthe whole composition.
The kind of theory teaching that would be of most use to the performer would consider his needs from this point of view. Since a performer needs to be able to formulate his conception of the composition
as a live experience constructed out of the dynamic materials of music,
which he will present to a listener as a pattern of experience in time, it
is essential that the student performer learn to see the materials of
music not merely as static elements to be dissected and labeled and
discussed according to dogmatic rules for "good" and "bad" progressions and stereotype formal concepts.
His theory study, no less than
his practical studies as performer,
should lead him to see music as
something with an independent energy of its own, resistant to manipulation, extending itself in time by its own momentum, with the power
to command the human mind and attention and to arouse incalculable

In sum, the level of performance I am describing here is that of
an intelligent musical performer sensitized to music with all his resources. He is not merely a highly trained automaton performing under
the direction of blind instinct, however refined blind musical instincts
may become. He is not merely a rational mind, dissecting and analyzing the dead carcass of a musical composition with a dry brain in a dry
season. In this performance the two have become one, a complete musical personality with mind and imagination and intuition working together toward producing an enlightening and communicative
performance which shall engage not only the player but the listener as well at
this enriched level of experience.
Such an enlightened level of study on the part of performers is
particularly important in this present age, when suddenly the world of
our cultural consciousness
has expanded in both space and time, and
the attitudes of other cultures and previous ages all clamor and compete for our understanding, and no one point of view and no one orientation is enough to serve performers
as a working philosophy.

above all, performers who can bring to their art and study and teaching
the fullest resources of insight and skill. Music is ONE study, in which
theory and practice function together. I am suggesting an ideal for that
study, which demands that neither theory nor performance should stand
alone, for music must have both at once.
