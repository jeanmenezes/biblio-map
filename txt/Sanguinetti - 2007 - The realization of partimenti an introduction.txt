The Realization of Partimenti
An Introduction

Giorgio Sanguinetti

Abstract  A partimento is a linear guide for the improvisation of a keyboard piece. Partimenti were developed
for the training of composers in the conservatories of Naples during the eighteenth century. They contain all the
information needed for the realization of complete pieces of music, and their practice bestowed on practitioners
a fluency in composition unparalleled since then. The Neapolitan masters usually recommended different stages
of realization, from the simplest (con le sole consonanze) to highly elaborate textures. The rules for the realization
of partimenti have survived in many sources, but they cover only the first stage of realization because the techniques for more advanced realizations were transmitted orally. With the decadence and extinction of the living
tradition, the realization of partimenti became a lost art. However, some principles for advanced realization may
be inferred from the surviving written realizations, and from the analysis of the partimento in question. Relying on
the foundation formed by the rules, and integrating them with these principles, the present article shows some
examples of how a present-day musician can create a satisfying realization.

The partimento as potential music

it is not easy to tell exactly what a partimento is. It is a basso continuo or
thoroughbass, but one that does not accompany anything except itself. It is
a figured bass, but very often it has no figures at all. It is a bass, but can as
well be a soprano, an alto, or a tenor. Whether tenor, alto, or soprano, it is
often the lowest voice, but sometimes it can skip from one voice to another
in the texture. It is written, but its goal is improvisation. And, finally, it is an
e
­ xercise—perhaps the most efficient exercise in composition ever devised—
but also a form of art in its own right. So, what is a partimento? Perhaps a good
definition is a metaphor: a partimento is a thread that contains in itself all,
or most, of the information needed for a complete composition. The classic
organicist metaphor of the seed might also be used, but usually the seed metaphor and its musical counterparts, like the Grundgestalt, do not develop in the
dimension of time. Rather, they are self-contained, like a thematic or motivic
statement. The partimento, by contrast, is a linear entity that runs from the
beginning to the end of a (potential) composition.
A partimento is only potentially music. Its implications need to be
unfolded in order for it to become a full-fledged composition. Every aspect of
the final music can be contained, or hinted at, in a partimento: tonal direcJournal of Music Theory  51:1, Spring 2007

tion, modulations, harmony, diminutions, imitations, texture, style, and genre.
There is, however, no single correct solution. Every partimento can allow an
unlimited number of possible realizations, according to the skills, taste, and
degree of sophistication of the performer-composer. In practice, partimento
masters often recommended a multilayered approach to partimento realization. At the beginning of book 4 of his Partimenti, Fedele Fenaroli (n.d. [ca.
1850], 61) warns his readers, “One should study the following partimenti first
with simple consonances, and subsequently with the dissonances, according
to the rules previously set forth.”1 A nineteenth-century author of an annotated edition of the same work, Emanuele Guarnaccia (ca. 1851, 3), goes a
step further: “To begin with, one will play all unfigured basses with simple
consonant chords: from that performance the Master will clearly understand
if his pupil has correctly understood the principles thereof. Secondly, one
shall introduce all feasible dissonances for that given bass. Lastly, one shall
shape the properly said Imitation.”2 In other words, the first step is a simple,
chordal realization based on the analysis of bass line, the identification of the
bass patterns, and their accompaniment using the simplest possible schemata
appropriate to those patterns. This stage was often referred to as con le semplici
consonanze (with simple consonances), but this did not mean that only consonant chords were used. In fact, by consonanze, partimento tradition meant
all the chords included in the basic accompaniment patterns, above all the
Rule of the Octave (for a discussion of this foremost rule, see Christensen
1992). As we shall see, the Rule of the Octave includes many dissonant chords,
like seventh chords in all inversions, and even an augmented sixth chord (on
descending ≤ in minor): all these chords were considered consonant.3
The second stage consists in adding dissonances to the basic realization.
By dissonanze, partimento theory means only one kind of dissonance: the suspension. Suspensions can be added to the simple realization either by scanning the bass line for appropriate locations or by choosing a more elaborated
variant of the same pattern that has already been used in the first stage.
The final stage of realization includes all those aspects that may bestow
on the partimento its distinctive shape and style: diminutions, imitation, and
texture. In practice, not every partimento is suitable for a three-stage realization. Yet even very simple partimenti, such as those in Fenaroli n.d. [ca. 1850],
book 3, can easily support a great number of possible realizations, from simple
block chords to amazingly complex polyphonic or even orchestral realization.

manifestation of a deeper tonal structure that is referred to
as basi fondamentali del tono (foundations of the key). I dis­
cuss this issue in Sanguinetti (in press-b).

  The Realization of Partimenti

More advanced partimenti, especially those with strong contrapuntal implications, like fugues, have a narrower range of possible realizations. In addition,
some elements of dissonance are already present in the basic schemata (e.g.,
the chromatic descent; see Example 7). Hence, one should not be too rigid
with the application of a two- or three-stage realization. Sometimes elements
of further stages will be introduced already in an earlier level.
The presence—or absence—of figures makes a great deal of difference.
In the Neapolitan tradition, fully figured partimenti are more the exception
than the rule. Partimenti are usually either totally (or almost totally) unfigured (e.g., in Fenaroli n.d. [ca. 1850], bks. 4 and 6, or in Francesco Durante’s
Diminuiti), or very little figured. On the other hand, partimenti with complicated figures do belong to different local traditions, such as the Bolognese
school of Padre Stanislao Mattei and the Roman school of Pietro Raimondi.
Unfortunately, more or less detailed instructions have survived only for
the first two stages of a realization. These instructions are usually titled regole
and principi (“rules” and “principles”) and are relatively abundant in European libraries, particularly in Italy. Except for the most celebrated of all—
those by Fenaroli—the regole are almost always in manuscript, whether they
bear the name of their author or not. The reason is that in Italian eighteenthcentury conservatories, a student obtained a textbook by copying it himself
from other manuscripts. Unlike formal treatises or manuals, regole and principi
are very sketchy. They are more like notes or aids for memory. The main focus
of the rules is on the realization of unfigured basses, based on the Rule of
the Octave and its complement, a series of bass patterns called moti del basso
(motions of the bass; the nature and structure of the regole are described more
accurately below). Therefore, it is not always easy to discern partimento rules
from thoroughbass rules. Both are based on the same principles, but a real
continuo treatise, such as Francesco Gasparini’s L’armonico pratico al cembalo
(1708), deals also with specific problems of accompaniment, such as the relations between the harpsichordist’s right hand and the solo part, while partimento rules completely ignore such issues.
As mentioned above, the second stage of realization consists in the
elaboration of the basic stage using the dissonanze, or suspensions (other dissonances, e.g., passing and neighboring notes, were considered as part of diminution, the third stage). The regole were generally quite accurate in the description of dissonances. For each kind of dissonance—fourth, seventh, ninth, and
second—they list all possible preparations and resolutions, and sometimes
they also suggest intricate patterns of different, interwoven ­ uspensions.
s
For the third stage there are, unfortunately for us today, no rules.
Clearly, this subject was considered too complicated to be suitable for written
rules, and it was entirely committed to an oral tradition. The oral transmission of knowledge was essential in the context in which the partimento tradition flourished, the conservatories of eighteenth-century Naples. In each of
the four conservatories that were active in Naples—in chronological order

53

of their founding: Santa Maria di Loreto (1537), Sant’Onofrio a Capuana
(1578), Santa Maria della Pietà dei Turchini (1583), and Poveri di Gesù Cristo
(1589)—students had daily lessons from their masters, and they also had the
assistance of tutors called maestrini. Oral tradition was certainly the best possible solution for teachers and students in a Neapolitan conservatory, but it
leaves us totally unprepared to decrypt the most advanced and challenging
partimenti, such as the toccatas, the sonatas, the concerti, and, above all, the
fugues. The present essay is intended as an introduction to the realization
of partimenti, from the simplest to the more advanced. It is based partly on
the regole, partly on a few surviving early examples of written realizations, and
partly on an empirical analysis of the partimenti. I do not deal with partimento
fugues because they would require a type of discussion that goes beyond the
limits of the present essay.
Partimento rules: An overview

In the eighteenth century, accompaniment from an unfigured bass was a
controversial Italian specialty. As Buelow (1986, 219–20) points out, it was
often sharply criticized by German musicians and theorists like Andreas
Werck­ eister, Johann Mattheson, and C. P. E. Bach. In more recent times a
m
G
­ erman-oriented scholar like Franck Thomas Arnold (1931) showed scant
interest in it. Apart from a certain nationalistic bias, German detractors of
unfigured basses had legitimate reasons for concern. There is little doubt
that figured basses provide a much more secure foundation for performance.
Unfigured basses, however, were used not only for accompaniment, but also—
and, I would say, principally—for teaching composition. For that purpose,
they are by far more useful than their figured counterparts. In fact, the realization of an unfigured bass calls into play the capacity to analyze the bass and
to understand the underlying tonal functions. The analysis of the bass line
is carried on primarily through the identification of linear patterns, which
leads to the selection of the best accompaniments from a set of alternative
solutions. In order to play an unfigured partimento, the student must memorize a remarkably (but not impossibly) large number of tonal paradigms, or
schemata. These paradigms would later become a repertoire of materials for
free composition. The examples that follow are based mainly on the rules of
Fenaroli. First published in 1775 as Regole musicali per i principianti di cembalo,
Fenaroli’s 117 rules have been repeatedly reprinted until the early decades of
the twentieth century, often together with the partimenti of the same author.4

4  In the discussion of the examples of realization, I refer
to the first edition (Mazzola-Vocola) for the Regole, and to
the mid-nineteenth-century Giovanni Canti edition for the
examples, because both have been reprinted in facsimile
and are easily available.

  The Realization of Partimenti

During their long history, the number of the rules increased until in the midnineteenth century (well after the death of their author) they reached the
number of 134, as in the Giovanni Canti edition (ca. 1850). Fenaroli himself
acknowledged the “open” nature of his rules when, at the end of the first
edition, he wrote, “Whenever [the learned Masters] shall find rules lacking,
or errors, they shall have the right to add, and adjust at their wish [the rules
in this book]; since what we did here is nothing but to put in order the rules
that everybody already knows perfectly, and to give beginners a guiding light,
so they will not play randomly.”5 Therefore, Fenaroli himself recognized his
rules as the systematization of a shared teaching tradition, a tradition that can
be traced back to Bernardo Pasquini and Alessandro Scarlatti. In other words,
his rules can be seen as a collective work, the result of a stratification of knowledge shared by generations of teachers and students. Fenaroli does not, however, cover all aspects of the theory. In order to get a more complete picture of
partimento theory as a whole, we must also refer to other sources, such as the
manuscript rules of Carlo Cotumacci (I-Nc Rari 1.9.14/1), Francesco Durante
(I-Bc E.E 171), Giovanni Furno (I-Nc Od. 1.6/1), Giacomo Insanguine (I-Mc
Noseda Th.c-116 a), Giovanni Paisiello (I-Nc 3.4.17 bis), Bernardo Pasquini
(I-Bc D. 138), Nicola Sala (I-Nc S.1.94), Alessandro Scarlatti (I-MOe Campori
g-L.9.41 and GB-Lbl Ms. Add. 14244), Saverio Valente (I-Mc Noseda Q 13–15,
13–16, 13–17), and the printed work of Tritto (1816) and Paisiello (1782).
Except for Pasquini in Rome, all these masters operated in one of the
Naples conservatories from the early eighteenth to the early nineteenth century. The regole that they wrote down allow us to become acquainted with a
large repertory of tonal patterns used in eighteenth-century composition.
All partimento rules fall into five classes, or categories:
Class 1: Basic axioms and procedures
Class 2: Rule of the Octave
Class 3: Suspensions
Class 4: Bass motions
Class 5: Scale mutations
This is not the order in which the rules are arranged in the sources—most of
them follow a more or less haphazard organization. Taken as a whole, however, the content of the various regole exhibits a remarkable consistency, albeit
with individual differences. As I have already said, partimento rules consist
in large part of harmonic and contrapuntal patterns, the memorization of
which is an essential prerequisite for partimento playing. In the short span

5  “Se mai trovassero regole mancanti, o errori, [i dotti Mae­
stri] potranno aggiungere, ed accomodare a loro piacere,
mentre qui altro non si è fatto se non mettere in ordine le
regole, che da tutti molto bene si sanno, e dare a’ principianti
un lume, acciò non suonino a caso” (55).

of an essay, it is impossible to detail all the partimento patterns. Therefore, I
discuss only those that are used in the realization of the subsequent musical
examples. The patterns are arranged according to the class of the rules.
Some partimento patterns and rules
Class 1: Basic axioms and procedures

Cadenze  In partimento theory, cadences have a double meaning. They are
closing formulas, but also the first significant tonal structure, composed with
an opening tonic, a middle dominant, and a closing tonic. Fenaroli considers
three types of cadences: simple (semplice), compound (composta), and double
(doppia). They are ordered according to the number of beats required by the
dominant. The simple cadence uses only the dominant triad (or seventh) and
occupies one beat; the compound cadence uses a 4–3 suspension and takes
up two beats; the double cadence needs four beats and consists of the formula
5 6 5 5
3 4 4 3. The performer can choose any of these cadences in one of the three
positions, with the tonic (first position) or the third (second position) or the
fifth (third position) in the top voice. Double cadences are best suited to the
final cadence (if four beats are available).6 Example 1 shows the three kinds
of cadences, in different positions and using different chords.
Cadential progressions  The next example shows cadences in which the
space between the opening tonic and the dominant is partially “filled in”
through a stepwise ascent. In partimento sources, there is not a single, consistent way of labeling these motions, so I use the modern term “cadential
progressions.”
Pasquini (I-Bc D. 138, 4–5) gives an account of this motion in the following way:
When one finds three notes [in the bass] that ascend stepwise, and the last
leaps downwards a fifth, or upwards a fourth, we shall give to the first note [the
chord of the] sixth; to the second, [the chord of the] fifth and sixth; to the third
note, fourth and third, and with the fourth the fifth is given too. . . . To the
note [of the bass immediately] before the cadence we shall always give fifth and
sixth together, and to the last [before the close] remember to play the fourth
followed by the third.7

This first rule illustrates the cadential progression I6 II6 V 5 3 I. Every time, as
3
5
4
Pasquini says, that we find in the bass three notes ascending by step followed
by a leap of a fifth down or a fourth up, we should use this chord progression.
At the same time, he states as mandatory the six-five chord on moving to ,

4

6  These are the most common types of cadence, but there
are others: for a complete list, see Sanguinetti (in press-b).
7  “Quando si trovano tre note che ascendono di grado e
l’ultima salta di 5. in giù ò 4. in sù si farà alla prima 6. alla
2., 5., e 6. alla 3. nota, 4. e 3., e con la 4. ci si intende la 5.

5

come in esempio [example follows]. Alla nota sotto cadenza
si dà sempre 5. e 6. assieme, et all’ultima si procuri di fare
la 4; e poi la 3.

and the 4–3 suspension on . At the beginning of Durante’s collection of partimenti and regole known as the Numerati, and disseminated in countless copies
in music libraries all over Europe, he offers examples of cadential progressions under the somewhat misleading name of cadenze semplici. In an example

Example 3.  Descending half step

3

through a lower neighbor with I6 appearing on ; in the third progression
3
(Example 2c) the space of the fifth is totally filled in, and the result is the lower
fifth of the ascending Rule of the Octave (see below).
Bass descending by half step  There are basically three possibilities for a
bass moving down a semitone. It can revert to its starting point to form a
neighbor-tone pattern (Example 3a), it can descend further (Example 3b, a
fragment of the Rule of the Octave), or it may stop after the half step (Example 3c). In the first case, the note after the semitone (sometimes called the
mi tone) takes the sixth, or a sixth plus a quinta falsa (diminished fifth), and
the fa tone above it takes a five-three chord. Durante calls the third case a
­erminazione di grado. This term means literally “stepwise ending,” which might
t
be translated as “stepwise cadence.” In his example, Durante shows an archetypical Phrygian cadence: a descending tetrachord with a half step between
the last two notes, and a 7–6 suspension on the next-to-last note. The motion
ends with a half cadence on the dominant. In a terminazione di grado the situation is the reverse of the first case: the mi note (after the half step) will have
a five-three chord with a major third (the dominant triad), and the sixth will
be displaced on the note before the half step (the fa note). Very often, this
fa note will last for two beats. In such cases the sixth is to be preceded by a
suspended seventh.
Class 2: The Rule of the Octave

The Rule of the Octave is the most basic and important rule of the partimento tradition and might be considered without exaggeration the paradigm
of the eighteenth-century concept of tonality. As Thomas Christensen (1992,
91) points out, “The idea behind the régle . . . is that each scale degree can
be associated with a unique harmony, one which reciprocally defines that
scale degree.” Thus, the Rule of the Octave (in its different versions) differs
from any other scale-based sequential pattern—such as 5–6 ascending, or 7–6
descending—because sequential patterns transpose the same chords on every
scale degree and therefore lack the key-defining power of the rule.
First described by the French lutenist François Campion (1716), the
Rule of the Octave is a model for the harmonization of the major and minor

Giorgio Sanguinetti

scale in both ascending and descending directions. Its central position in the
partimento practice lies in the fact that the Rule of the Octave is the cornerstone of unfigured bass accompaniment. The Neapolitan masters favored
several different versions of this rule, but eventually one version became standard, the one described by Fenaroli (see Example 4). The harmonic frame is
the same as in Campion, but Fenaroli devises for this scale an efficient voice
leading that makes it usable in all three positions. The Fenaroli scale settles
the problem of consecutive six-three chords, which prevented some earlier
versions from using all three positions, and avoids all direct successions of
triads. The introduction of two dissonant six-five chords on and further
reinforces the tonal coherence of the system. The only problematic connection is between
and , where the alto voice doubles the tenor, and the
remaining voices are forced to rise in direct motion with the bass. Example
4 shows the Fenaroli scale realized in all three positions (with the octave, the
third, and the fifth in the upper voice).

Class 3: Dissonances (suspensions)

In partimento theory only suspensions are considered dissonances. All other
dissonances (those resulting from melodic motion) are considered part of
diminution. For example, the seventh on the dominant is considered a passing tone, and is usually referred to as quinta del tono con la passata della settima.
Of all four dissonances (fourth, seventh, ninth, and second), only the last,
the second, occurs in the bass. In fact, every time a syncopated or tied note
occurs in the bass, it is always treated as a suspension and is accompanied with
a second and a fourth in the upper voices. The quality of the fourth depends
on the direction of the bass motion. If the bass after the syncopation descends
one half step and then comes back to the previous note, then the fourth of
the accompaniment must be perfect (Example 5a). If the bass continues its
descent, then the fourth will be augmented (Example 5b). In the first case,
the bass outlines a lower-neighbor figure in the same scale. In the second case,
after the syncopation, the bass proceeds four tones downward, and the note
on which the motion ends will be considered a new tonic. In other words, the
augmented fourth transforms the bass note that supports it into the fourth
degree of a new scale. This was called an instance of scale mutation, or terminazione di tono.
Class 4: Bass motions

Bass motions can be divided in two groups: those with conjunct and disjunct
motions. Conjunct motions include all stepwise progressions of the bass in
the same direction, both diatonic and chromatic. Disjunct motions coincide
mostly with sequences, that is, with regular transpositions of a model (an interval). Often conjunct bass motions (in themselves not sequential) may utilize

are elaborations of a series of 7–6 suspensions. The pattern shown in Example
7 is by far the favorite (but not the only) accompaniment for a descending
chromatic motion. Examples of it abound in all musical literature. Its fame is
due perhaps to its being the so-called lamento bass: the descending tetrachord
that since the seventeenth century has been a symbol of lament in music. The
7–6 suspensions enhance the expressive power of the bass and call for a slower
tempo than the diatonic 7–6. There are two positions: with tenths in the upper
voice and with 7–6 suspensions in the upper voice.
8  Following Neapolitan usage, the “X” indicates the interval
of the tenth above the bass.

being ton­
ally indifferent, should not have any limitations of range. However, partimento
theory—like most tonal theories in the eighteenth century—­ onsidered chroc
maticism as subordinate to the governing diatonic structure. Since the diaˆ ˆ
ˆ ˆ
tonic scale already includes two “diatonic” semitones (between 3– 4 and 7– 8),

they have priority over the chromatic ones. As Example 8 illustrates, a continuous chromatic ascent from to cannot allow a regular alternation of fifth
and sixth, because

Example 8.  Distribution of diatonic and chromatic semitones

As a result, chromatic motions either avoid touching the diatonic semitones, confining themselves to a portion of the octave (the longest segment is
ˆ ˆ
a 3– 6), or exhibit irregular alternations of fifths and sixths. Example 9 shows
Fenaroli’s solution for a chromatic ascent through the complete octave. It
is made possible by two expedients: the repetition of
and the stop of the
chromatic motion on . The first technique allows the “double employment”
of , first as a diatonic tone (with fifth) and then as a chromatic tone (with
sixth), thus permitting the regular pace of the sequence. The second strataJMT 51:1 149-3 Sanguinetti ex. 9
gem avoids the tonicization of the leading tone, which would conflict with the
tonal feeling. The voice-leading pattern is a chromatic version of the ascending 5–6.

semitone motion is described by all collections of rules and corresponds with
one of the oldest continuo rules. We can read it in the earliest sources, such as
Galeazzo Sabbatini (1628) and Lorenzo Penna (1672). Scarlatti (I-MOe Cam­
pori g-L.9.41, c. 4r) calls this the regola universale indispensabile (universal and
indispensable rule) and extends its application both to diatonic (per natura)
and to chromatic (per accidente) half steps. Similarly, Pasquini (I-Bc D. 138, 4)
admits its validity to “all notes that we call mi fa.” The rule states that the note
moving upward is accompanied by the sixth, and the next note by the fifth.
The sequential motion is diatonic and therefore also uses ascending whole
tones. But it always begins on one of the two diatonic semitones: – or – .

second is major, was called by Joseph Riepel a Fonte (1755). Example 11 shows
five possible accompaniments: except for the last, all derive from the first.
Class 5: Scale mutations (terminazioni di tono)

The descending motion called by Durante terminazione di grado (see Example
3) is a special case of terminazione di tono, an event described by all partimento
masters except Fenaroli. The term means literally “key ending,” and it indicates a tonal motion that ends in some different key. It has obvious affinities
with the concepts of modulation and tonicization, but its specific meaning
is related to the practice of unfigured bass. The accompaniment of a bass
without figures depends entirely on the awareness of the scale that is in use at
any moment. Without a clear understanding of the local key, the accompanist
would be totally lost. When he identifies one of the patterns of a terminazione di
tono, the partimento player knows that the scale he has been using is going to
change to a new one, and that he must base the new patterns on the new scale.
For this reason, I suggest translating terminazione di tono as “scale mutation.”
Furno (I-Nc Od. 1.6/1) describes four bass motions that may induce a
scale mutation, two ascending and two descending (as discussed below, there
are also other ways to produce a scale mutation). When the bass moves up a
semitone, the two notes a minor second apart become
and
of the new
scale. When the bass moves up a whole tone, the two notes a major second apart
become and of the new scale. When the bass moves down a semitone, the
two notes a minor second apart become and of the new scale. When the
bass moves down a whole tone, the two notes a major second apart become
and of the new scale. The Phrygian cadence described by Durante as terminazione di grado clearly must have a fermata on the last note. But this is not
necessary for a terminazione di tono, which is usually followed by a confirmation
of the new scale (through a cadence or a cadential ­ rogression).

A simple realization of an unfigured partimento:
Fenaroli, book 4, no. 2

The selection of patterns I have hitherto introduced, though only a fraction of
those offered by Fenaroli and the other masters, may allow us to sketch a realization of a simple unfigured partimento. A good choice would be the second
lesson from Fenaroli’s book 4, which consists entirely of unfigured partimenti.
The partimento is reproduced in Example 12. The numbered brackets are
my addition and show a segmentation of the bass line with reference to the
patterns listed below.
Example 12 shows the following patterns:

1.	Chromatic descending motion from to
2.	Cadential progression
3. 	 2–3 suspension with terminazione di tono

Example 12.  Fenaroli book 4, no. 2 (with symbols added)

4. 	Cadenza
5. 	 Ascending stepwise and descending by third
6. 	Chromatic ascent
For the accompaniment to the first segment we can choose one of the two
positions of the pattern in Example 7. The choice depends on the appropriate
level of rhythmic activity in the upper voice, and the possibility of a smooth
voice-leading connection with the next pattern.
Segment 2 (bars 2–3, 8–9, and 17–19) consists of a cadential progression
and entails the chord progression I6–II6–V 5–I. Since the dominant
3
5
3
lasts only one beat, there is no place for 4–3 suspensions such as those shown
by Durante in Example 2. Notice the passing tone that connects the beginning
of segment two with the previous segment. In all three instances, this will be
left unaccompanied.
The main feature in segment 3 consists of a suspension in the bass. Rules
of class 3 state that all suspended basses must be accompanied by a four-two
chord (the sixth is a frequent, though not strictly necessary, addition). The
problem is the quality of the fourth—is it perfect or augmented? Usually con-

tinuo basses indicate this with the appropriate figures, but there are no figures
in Fenaroli’s book 4. The problem is easily resolved if we observe the behavior
of the bass. After the descending resolution, it does not come back to the first
note, but continues its descent a fifth downward. We recognize the figure
known as a bass suspension with scale mutation (con terminazione di tono), and
according to the above-mentioned rule, we also know that the quality of the
fourth in the suspension must be augmented.
Segment 4 (bars 5–6 and 14–15) consists of the bass leaping a fifth or
a fourth. This motion is called a cadenza and in its complete form entails a
motion from a tonic to a dominant and back to a tonic (the motion in bars
14–15 is an incomplete cadenza repeated twice). As we have seen in connection
with the rules of class 1, the Neapolitan masters classified the cadenze according to the metrical units of the dominant. In both cases the dominant lasts
two beats, thus allowing the metrical space for a cadenza composta. However,
in bars 5–6 a cadenza doppia is a good possibility because the bass leaping by
octave allows the two beats needed for the 4–3 suspension without voice-leading complications. Conversely, the double cadence (with 4–3 suspension) is
not a good choice for the same segment in bars 14–15 because the bass moves
to the third together with the resolution of the suspension. A simple cadence
is better suited here.
For segment 5 we have an ample choice of patterns, but for the moment
we shall confine ourselves to the simplest one (this passage is designed for a
different kind of elaboration). For the chromatic ascent in bars 12–14, we can
use the ascending pattern shown in Example 9.
Now we can sketch a first attempt at a realization. The realization in
Example 13, though intended as a first stage, is in truth a hybrid because it
incorporates passages with suspensions. Indeed, for the chromatic segments
1 and 6, even the simplest accompaniment patterns already include suspensions. On the other hand, other passages, like bars 14–15 and, particularly,
bars 9–11, sound empty and dull. A further stage of elaboration will find a
solution to these problems. What makes bars 9–11 sound unconvincing is
the sudden stop of the rhythmic activity in the second half of bars 9 and 10.
Although the surface rhythm of this partimento often moves by eighth notes,
the essential rhythmic pulse—the rate with which harmonic and voice-leading
events change—moves by quarter notes throughout the piece. The halt in
bars 9 and 10, therefore, is not accidental. Rather, it is a signal that something
must take place here. This something is an imitation. Example 14 shows a
further stage of elaboration for bars 9 to 15.
In general, we can state this principle: in partimento practice, any abrupt
interruption of the rhythmic pulse calls for a continuation of the same rhythm
in the accompaniment, and often signals the entrance of an imitation. The

performer, therefore, must restore the rhythmic continuity of the partimento
by introducing a complementary rhythm. (For a more chromatic realization
of this same partimento, see the article by Stella, this issue.)
Shaping a partimento: The art of diminution

The pedagogy of diminution was developed in Italy during the Renaissance
and the Baroque era and was codified in several famous treatises. These range
from early examples like Sylvestro Ganassi’s Fontegara (1535) and Giovanni
Battista Bovicelli’s Regole, passaggi di musica, madrigali et motetti passeggiati (1594)
to later ones like Francesco Rognoni’s Selva de varii passaggi (1620). Although
in Europe this pedagogical tradition eventually became obsolete, in Naples
diminution continued as an essential part of composition training well into
the eighteenth century. A counterpoint student trained in the Durante tradition would practice endlessly writing diminutions on partimento schemata
such as the cadenze, the Rule of the Octave, and the different bass patterns.
According to the surviving documents, Leonardo Leo’s tradition was different and closer to a Fuxian approach (see Sanguinetti, in press-a). As has been
mentioned, rules explaining exactly how to transform a basic realization into a
more elaborate composition do not exist. There are, however, several sources
from which we may infer some principles about advanced realization. Some
authors, and most notably Durante in his Diminuiti and Fenaroli in his book
5, provide a few bars of realization before some partimenti in order to give
the performer a hint about the intended texture and thematic content. In
addition, there are some realizations of partimenti from the early nineteenth
century (mostly in manuscript) that may give us an idea of how an advanced
style of partimento realization might sound.
In general, one might say that if the simple realization of a partimento
resembles a standard continuo realization, the decorated realization differs in
the following features:
(a) 	 The rhythmic activity of the right hand is usually faster than the
harmonic rhythm.
(b) 	 The right-hand line often consists of a “polyphonic” melody.
(c) 	 The left hand may take part in the realization of inner voices.
(d) 	 The realization follows the principle of complementary rhythms.
One might perhaps say that the process of reworking a continuo-like realization of a partimento into a version with diminutions is the exact opposite of
the reduction of a complete composition in what Rothstein (1991) calls the
“imaginary continuo.”
As mentioned above, there are very few surviving documents of realized partimenti, especially from the central period of the tradition—the eighteenth century. The reason is that partimenti were used for improvised performance, so there was little need for written-out realizations. At the beginning of

71

72

J our n a l o f M usi c T h eory

the nineteenth century, however, the practice of improvisation declined, and
partimenti began to be realized in written form. Thus, the nature of the partimento underwent a slow but inexorable transformation into the harmony
exercise (the typical late-nineteenth-century realization of a Fenaroli partimento is a four-voice, block-chord, melodically steady school work). Luckily,
some early-nineteenth-century realizations have survived (and perhaps more
are to be discovered) that may allow us a glimpse into the authentic tradition.
One of the most significant documents is the manuscript I-MOe F.370 in the
Estense library in Modena, which contains the realization of partimenti by
Fenaroli and Durante.9 The author of the realizations, Angelo Catelani, studied partimento in the Real Collegio di Musica in Naples with Giovanni Furno,
a disciple of Carlo Cotumacci, who was in turn a student of Durante (his other
teachers at the Real Collegio di Musica were Gaetano Donizetti, Nicolò Zinga­
relli, and Girolamo Crescentini). The date of the manuscript is unknown, but
Catelani states in his autobiography that he joined the Real Collegio in 1831,
so this manuscript must have been written shortly after. Since the line of transmission is very short and direct, we can take Catelani’s realizations as closely
representative of the Durante tradition.
As an example I have chosen a partimento from one of the two surviving
series of partimenti di Durante, the so-called Diminuiti (Example 15). Durante’s
partimenti have been transmitted through countless manuscript copies, and
only recently have been published on paper by Giuseppe Pastore (Durante
2003) and on the Web site Monuments of Partimenti edited by Robert Gjerd­
ingen.10 The partimento is listed as no. 20 in the online edition, and as no. 12
of the Pastore edition.
The Diminuiti are totally unfigured, but Durante supplied for each of
them a few bars of hints for their realization, usually with alternative solutions.
The performer may choose his or her favorite model of texture and apply it
to the whole partimento or, of course, invent a different solution. Both possibilities offered by Durante for partimento no. 20 point to a light texture in the
style of a two-voice invention. The partimento is clearly subdivided in phrases
by the cadences, easily recognizable by the bass leaping an octave.11 The leap
occupies two beats, so the cadences belong to the second type, the cadenza composta, and need therefore a 4–3 suspension. The first challenge posed to the
performer is the completion of the first phrase (mm. 1–6), which overlaps the
beginning of the second phrase (mm. 6–9). The second phrase repeats the
beginning of the first, but the G≥ in bar 7 sets out a scale mutation followed by

5 and 6 of Fenaroli (complete) and an appendix with the
realizations of 24 partimenti of Durante.
10  Pastore’s edition is based on an eighteenth-century man­
uscript (I-LE Pastore MS.A.5) that has been in the posses­
sion of his family for several generations. Unfortunately, this

edition is flawed by an exceptionally high number of errors,
which make it unsuitable for any use (except, perhaps, as a
thematic catalog).

bars concluded by a cadence. In the case of a group of
cadences, the phrase is concluded by the last cadence of
the group.

a cadence in the key of the minor dominant, the correct realization of which
is the purpose of this second phrase. The third phrase (mm. 10–15) repeats
the first exactly, but transposed up a fifth, so transposition here is the new
task. Phrase 4 (mm. 16–29) exhibits a progressive fragmentation of the material exposed in the first phrases. The initial part of this phrase (mm. 16–21)
consists of two-bar units composed of the first eight notes of the first phrase
followed by the last two beats of bar 5. This unit is twice transposed up a third.
In bar 22, after the third transposition, the performer abruptly encounters a
new fragment, which is a slight modification of bar 2. The immediate recognition of it, and the matching of it with its correct counterpart, is probably the
most difficult challenge that this partimento presents to the performer. Bars
23–28 consist of the repetition and transposition of a descending tetrachord
followed, and concluded, by a cadence in the home key. It is not immediately

Example 16.  Motivic overlapping in bars 22–30 of Catelani’s realization

obvious that the tetrachord derives from the conclusion of the figure in bar
22, which in turn appears already in bars 2–3. The performer should therefore
utilize the correspondent right-hand figures and at the same time attempt to
coordinate them into a continuous, flowing eighth-note rhythm. The fifth
phrase pushes the limit of the minor hexachord that so far had contained the
left-hand figures and moves up all the way through the octave. The performer
now faces the delicate problem of the alterations in the minor scale. The last
phrase consists in a reiteration of the closing cadence, preceded by a twofold
repetition of the descending tetrachord.
In his realization, Catelani chooses the second model, keeping essentially to a two-voice texture. Occasional entrances of a third voice fill in the
harmony or make explicit an inner voice already hinted at in the polyphonic
melody of bar 2 of Durante’s template (the complete realization is shown in
Example 16).
The technique of realization is based primarily on the memorization,
and recognition, of the matching patterns of bass and upper voice. In the first
phrase, the bass essentially ascends and slowly descends through the lower
tetrachord of the D-minor scale, and the upper voice accompanies this motion
by moving in tenths with the bass, thus continuing the model of realization
suggested by Durante. Incidentally, this realization corresponds to the typical “Prinner” schema of the galant style, as described by Gjerdingen (2007,
45–60). For the first cadence in bar 5, Catelani chooses an unusual ascending
realization using a series of three successive reaching-over motions. This solution allows the second phrase to develop in the upper register, which gives
space for the elaborate cadence in bars 8 and 9. For the realization of the

third phrase (mm. 10–15), Catelani transposes exactly his realization of the
first phrase, except for the cadence that now is kept in the low register. Bars
16–21 of the fourth phrase are obviously realized as a sequence. Far less obvious is the realization of the further fragmentation in bars 23–29. As we have
already observed, this passage is made entirely with a descending tetrachord
that is directly derived from the conclusion of the preceding phrase (and,
less directly, from the structural bass notes in bars 2–5). Instead of accompa-

¼

nying the bass with the corresponding upper-voice fragment as in bars 2–3
(four notes in parallel motion by tenths), Catelani chooses the more complex
solution shown in Example 16. In doing so, he overlaps the repetition (on
different registers) of the same tetrachord in the bass (D–C–B–A, bars 23–25;
C–B–A–G, bars 25–27: see lower brackets in Example 17) with three different
motives (a, b, c: see the upper brackets in Example 17; incidentally, bracket
“b” corresponds to the Fonte schema).
After the cadence in bar 28, the ascending motion that begins the first
phrase continues through a complete octave. Catelani takes this as encouragement for an imitation, so instead of overlapping the end of phrase 4 with the
beginning of phrase 5, he leaves the first bar of the new phrase (m. 29) unaccompanied and starts an imitation on the next bar. In the last phrase, Durante
seems to suggest a close on two registers: first with the repetition of the tetrachord (mm. 33–35), then with the repetition of the cadenza semplice (mm.
36–38). The realization adheres strictly to this disposition but seems to distinguish between a principal and a secondary register. In fact, Catelani chooses to
conclude the upper register with a stronger cadence in first position, and the
lower with a weaker cadence in second position.
An advanced realization of an unfigured partimento:
Fenaroli book 4, no. 13

Keeping in mind the essential principles of the advanced realization and the
example of Catelani, we might attempt to realize an unfigured partimento
using diminutions and imitations in order to obtain an idiomatic keyboard
texture (see Example 18). As always, the first step will be an analysis of the bass,
and its segmentation into recognizable patterns. This task is more difficult to
accomplish here than in Fenaroli’s book 4, no. 2 (Example 12), because the
bass itself is much more elaborated, and the essential rhythmic pulse ranges
from one each bar (as in bars 1–4) to three (as in bars 5–6).
The patterns are as follows:

15

1. 	 Stepwise ascent –
2. 	Cadential progression ( )
3. 	 Do-si-do (complement to do-re-mi)
4. 	 Descending by thirds (triads)
5. 	 Scale mutation with ascending semitone –
6. 	 Ascending by fourths and descending by fifths
7. 	
– in minor

1 3451

78

61

The next preliminary step is the identification of the phrases (the span of
music delimitated by the cadences). In this partimento there is only one kind
of cadence, the cadential progression –( )– – , with acting (when present) as an embellishment of . These cadential progressions are in bars 6–7,
13–14, 18–19 (repeated in 20–21), 27–28, 34–35, 39–40, and 45 (repeated).

Example 18.  Fenaroli book 4, no. 13

So, if we discard the reiterated cadences (e.g., those in bars 19–21 and 45–48),
there are seven phrases.
The phrases are grouped in a ternary form with recapitulation: the first
section (A) is composed with phrases 1–3; section B, with phrases 4 and 5; section A, with phrases 6 and 7.
Phrase 1: Bars 1–7  An elementary voice-leading analysis will confirm
that the sixteenth notes in bars 1–4 are diminutions of a single note, the first

78

J our n a l o f M usi c T h eory

one in each bar. The essential motion in these bars is therefore a segment of
the D-major scale, D–E–F≥–G–A (segment 1: bars 1–5). As we have seen in the
second section of the present essay, there are several ways to accompany an
ascending motion. The first and most important is the Rule of the Octave.
According to it, we should give a five-three to the D, a six-four-three to the E,
a six-three to the F≥, a five-three (or six-five) to the G, and a five-three to the
A. In his book 3, Fenaroli lists other patterns for the accompaniment of the
ascending stepwise motion: the 5–6, the 7–6, and the 9–8 (see Example 6).
At this stage, there is no way to tell which pattern is the better suited for this
occasion. A good strategy is to wait for other hints before choosing one solution. This first phrase is closed with a cadential progression (segment 2: bars
5–7) in which bass degrees and are slightly embellished by a skip down
a third. As usual, cadences bring about a slowing down of the surface rhythm
and an acceleration of the harmonic rhythm.
Phrase 2: Bars 7–14  After the cadence we might expect that the rhythm
resumes the original pace in sixteenths, but instead it keeps moving in eighth
notes. This sudden slowing down of the surface rhythm very often signals the
presence of thematic elements in double counterpoint and the possibility for
imitation. The essential figure of segment 3 is
or do-si-do, a pattern
that in partimento practice always combines with its complement,
or do-re-mi (for the terms do-si-do and do-re-mi, see Gjerdingen 2007, 77–88).
This latter figure, in turn, corresponds to the first three notes of segment 1:
segments 1 and 3 are therefore in double counterpoint (at least for the first
three notes). This discovery has remarkable consequences for the realization
of both segments. Concerning segment 1, the do-si-do pattern coincides with
the first three notes of the upper voice in first position of the Rule of the
Octave. Accordingly, this will be the basis for the accompaniment to segment
1. Conversely, as an accompaniment to segment 3, the right hand will reproduce exactly the first three bars of the bass. The imitation cannot proceed
beyond the third bar—the fourth bar of segment 1 is in fact incompatible with
the beginning of the new segment 4 (bar 9). The rule governing the accompaniment of this segment is very simple. It states that every new bass note must
have a triad. Clearly, a sudden break in the sixteenth run is hardly desirable
here, so a way to continue the previous motion must be found. The third
bass note of this pattern, however, is chromatically raised—G≥ instead of GΩ.
This is the ascending terminazione di tono (scale mutation) described in class
5 as the first of Furno’s four terminazioni di tono and brings in the new scale
of A major (cadential confirmation follows immediately after). According to
the rule, the chromatically raised note in the bass must have the sixth, not
the fifth (a diminished fifth—quinta falsa—may be added to the sixth chord).
The last two bars of the phrase consist in a cadential progression. Even if the
surface rhythm continues as before, the cadence allows a slower pace in the
right hand.
Phrase 3: Bars 14–21  This phrase is divided in two segments: segment 5
(bars 14–17) is a sequence composed with a model and three transpositions,

3

Giorgio Sanguinetti 

  The Realization of Partimenti

clearly followed by a repeated cadential progression leading to a fermata. The
sequence in segment 5 is called by Fenaroli “bass ascending by fourth and
descending by fifth” and allows a large number of possible accompaniments:
Example 10 shows a small selection of patterns. In order to be used in this
context, any pattern of accompaniment must be converted into a fast and
light texture, using the appropriate diminutions. The following cadential progressions may or may not alternate eighths and sixteenths in complementary
motion with the bass.
Phrase 4: Bars 22–28  According to Durante, when a stepwise dyad
occurs in the bass with the two tones a half step apart, and the motion stops
on the second tone, the first or fa tone needs the sixth, and the second or
mi tone the fifth. The CΩ–B motion corresponds also to the third of Furno’s
four terminazioni di tono and will be confirmed by a cadence at the end of the
phrase. These rapid notes represent a diminution of a bass that essentially
circles around B (with G supporting a neighboring harmony). We understand
this tonally ambiguous passage properly only in retrospect, when the cadential progression in bars 26–28 makes it clear that the local key is E minor, and
the C is the (natural) sixth degree of this scale. The Rule of the Octave offers
several possibilities for this scale degree. When lowered descends on , we
can use the minor third and major sixth, minor third and augmented sixth,
or minor third, augmented fourth, and augmented sixth.
Phrase 5: Bars 28–35  Phrase 5 brings the harmony from II back to I.
Bars 28–33 are a transposition one step lower of bars 21–26. Together they
form a large-scale Fonte, one which makes use of root-position dominants
(instead of six-five, first-inversion ones). This scheme will affect the realization, too, suggesting that we make bar 28 as a variant of bar 21, despite the
different harmonic situation. The bass in m. 21 makes use of the ascending
terminazione di tono (scale mutation) described in class 5 as the first of Furno’s
four terminazioni di tono. The CΩ of the previous phrase is now corrected as C≥
in bar 29, followed by D in bar 30: the two notes a semitone apart become
and of D major, and the new key is confirmed by two cadential progressions,
the second “nested” within the first (see the nested brackets in bars 28–33 of
Example 18).
Phrases 6 and 7: Bars 35–40 and 40–48  These two phrases together form
the recapitulation. Their order is inverted, so that phrase 6 corresponds to
phrase 2 (except for the scale mutation) and phrase 7 to phrase 1. With all
the preceding observations in mind, we may now attempt to draft a possible
realization of Fenaroli book 4, no. 13 (see Example 19).

Given the introductory nature of this essay, the issue of partimento realization
cannot be taken much beyond its first steps. As I hinted at earlier, partimenti
could assume virtually every genre, form, and style of music, especially, though
not exclusively, styles of keyboard music. Leonardo Leo was especially fond

of partimenti in the style of a concerto or a toccata. Durante wrote beautiful examples of Galant sonatas in partimento notation. At the beginning
of the tradition, Bernardo Pasquini and Gaetano Greco wrote organ versetti
as partimenti. And, of course, fugue was considered the crowning glory of
all partimento studies and was practiced by all Neapolitan masters. Besides
those already mentioned, Pasquale Cafaro, Cotumacci, Sala, Zingarelli, and
many others left behind partimento fugues. The realization of these different
genres, forms, and styles of partimenti clearly encompasses more subtle and
intricate issues than those I have dealt with here, but the fundamental tasks
of realization do not change: memorization of the rules, analysis of the bass,
recognition of patterns, and—above all—a mind open to all possible suggestions that the composer disseminated in the partimento itself.

Example 19 (continued)

As I have said, there are very few surviving written realizations of partimenti, and most of them are from the nineteenth century. Of eighteenthcentury realizations, very little is known. The reason for the paucity of written
realization from what we might call the “golden age” of partimento is simple—
as mentioned, realizations were improvised. It is likely, therefore, that all the
stages we went through—analysis, pattern identification, recognition of harmonic rhythm, problems of voice leading, localization of cadences, and so
on—were instantly negotiated without the need for reflection. Equally likely is
that this (almost) unconscious act of composing was the goal toward which the
Neapolitan masters tirelessly trained their pupils. So an eighteenth-century
student at Santa Maria della Pietà dei Turchini probably would make his (I am
afraid that students in the four conservatories were all male) first attempts at
partimento playing by following a path more or less as I have described it. As
his skills became more secure, however, he could simply let his fingers “compose” for him in a quasi-automatic way.
Every day, for five to ten years, composition students in Naples had lessons from their masters, who instructed them in partimento, counterpoint,
singing, and free composition. This was (at least initially) based on solfeggi,
which might well be considered as the natural extension of partimento training. If we keep in mind that during the seventeenth and the eighteenth centuries the Naples conservatories were the only institutionalized music schools
in the world, it is clear that a composer who graduated in Naples was supposed
to have had the best possible professional training. Among the students’ most

impressive skills were not only the ability to compose with astounding rapidity
but also the dexterity to emulate different styles convincingly, skills indispensable if one wanted to survive in the boisterous opera market of the eighteenth
(and nineteenth) century. Partimento training played a decisive role in the
development of these skills and contributed greatly in shaping eighteenthcentury compositional technique.
