of

These are substantial goals indeed, and one might well wonder
with some anxiety to what extent Schillinger has realized them. If the
composition of music can be reduced to the application of mathematical
logic, it is high time we realized the fact and incorporated it into our
musical thinking.
Two possible consequences
come to mind: on the
one hand, so much new material would be available to composers that
music would grow and blossom rapidly in fresh directions,
dwarfing in
new glory all that has been done before; on the other hand, with composing reduced to mathematical principles,
practically everyone could
be his own composer,
and music might smother in its own surfeit.
Either of these consequences
seems important enough to warrant an
evaluation of Schillinger's
work.
A search of the professional journals unfortunately does not help
us to arrive at such an evaluation.
Reviews of Composition upon its
publication cover quite a range of opinion. There is praise of the work
as a great advance in revitalizing
musical theory and placing it on a
scientific foundation [11;2], complaints about its mathematical approach
that the whole thing is worthless [5;6;7].
In a
[3;4], and assertions
very conscientious and careful review [8] J. Murray Barbour concludes
that the claims made by Shaw and Dowling regarding the value of the
work are not substantiated by a critical examination, and that Schillinger is not as competent an authority in all fields of music as he pretends to be.
Aside from the reviews, there is very little mention of Schillinger
in the literature,
and that which exists has generally a little of the
flavor of patent medicine testimonials?
Nowhere is there an evaluation
of the scientific and mathematical
foundations of Schillinger's
system
to help the non-mathematical
musician assess its importance.
Musicians in general seem rather unwilling to discuss the subject; not being

and scientists,

they are understandably
criticize a system which claims to have a foundation in mathematics
and science.
Even if its musical results do not amount to much at
present, there is the possibility that basically it is sound and will ultimately realize the claims made for it by its spokesmen.
Let us therefore examine as much of Schillinger's work as may
be necessary
to evaluate its soundness in the areas of science and
mathematics.
Composition begins with Book I, "Theory of Rhythm' An editorial
preface states that this theory is basic to the entire work, so we shall
examine it in detail.
Chapter I begins with a discussion of graphs, illustrated by the
of a simple musical sound such as the sound wave from
representation
a tuning fork (the curve mathematicians
call a sine wave). In the discussion of this curve on p. 2, we find two errors: the word phase is
used incorrectly,
and the term amplitude is taken to be synonymous
with intensity.
Physically,
intensity is proportional to the square of
the amplitude of a simple sound wave, so the two words are not
synonymous. However, we find on reading further that Schillinger

To describe the process somewhat differently: to find the "resultant" of 4 and 3, assume a measure of 4 x 3 = 12 beats, such as eighth

Schillinger uses his "rhythm graphs" to picture these patterns.
The last pattern above (without rests) would look like the following,

where time is plotted horizontally,
as mentioned before, and the small
squares represent eighth notes.
He also expresses
them numerically,
getting for the pattern

of "series of factorialChapter 12 begins with a discussion
fractional continuity' each "series" having a "determinant tt" The term
determinant is not used here in its accepted mathematical
meaning,
and there is no such thing in mathematics as "factorial-fractional
continuity.' A discussion of the application of these "series" to music ensues; this material would be very important to musical analysis if it
had any verifiable basis, but again not a single example or illustration
is given to lend credence to the assertions made. (There is one minor
exception, a reference to the literature on p. 72, the first such, incidentally, to appear in the book.)
A typical Schillinger assertion appears on p. 74: "The law of distributive powers is a common esthetic law of proportionate distribution
of harmonic contrasts.'
This sounds important, so we would like to
know what it means.
The subsequent material discusses
"distributive
powers" using numbers and graphs, and this time we are able to discover what the term signifies.
It is simple enough: if, for example,
we multiply out (3 + 1) x (3 + 1) we get 9 + 3 + 3 + 1, applying the usual

another assertion with no basis but numerology.
The concluding chapter of the "Theory of Rhythm" begins with
the statement:
"The only constant velocity known in the physical world
is that of light"' This is nonsense; the velocity of light is not constant,
but depends on the medium in which the light is traveling.
Schillinger
obviously has heard somewhere the postulate of the special theory of
relativity, that light has the same velocity for all observers regardless
of their state of relative motion, and has misinterpreted
it. The second
paragraph begins with the sentence: "The ratios of acceleration through
of gravity is a constant at any
gravity grow rapidly!' The acceleration
given place, varying only slightly over the earth's surface, and cannot
grow at all; the expression "ratios of acceleration" is meaningless.
Having considered "Theory of Rhythm" in some detail, we can
form several conclusions: (a) there is practically nothing in it that can
be dignified by the name mathematics;
(b) it contains a number of
errors and much misused mathematical terminology;
(c) terms important to the discussion are frequently defined incomprehensibly

Another error in elementary physics occurs on p. 359. Schillinger

triad as 5:6:15, which is quite wrong, and the ratios for the dominant
seventh chord as 4:5:6:7, which is also wrong. His physics is obviously
no better than his mathematics.
We need not waste time on the remainder of the work. We continue to see formidable arrays of formulas and graphs, but the actual
mathematical content remains infinitesimal.
One might hope that Mathematical Basis (Schillinger's
"mastermaterial so lacking in
work") would contain some of the illustrative
Composition, material necessary to lend some validity to the assertions
made and to raise the work at least somewhat above the level of numerology. Unfortunately, a study of Mathematical Basis reveals nothing
more than the same pseudo-mathematical
jargon and extensive numerical working out of trivial mathematical formulas.
The numerology is
extended to cover art and design as well as music; the sections on music are copied verbatim from Composition, and the whole hodge-podge
is given the impressive title, "Theory of Regularity and Coordination.'
We conclude finally that Schillinger's claim to have established a
scientific and mathematical basis for music and the arts is nonsense.
What little science and mathematics we find is trivial when not actually

Mathematical Basis was first introduced to the author by a musician acquaintance of the Hollywood school, who commented in awed
tones on the vast amount of science and mathematics
it contained.
However, a strong "crackpot" odor was evident on the first examination, and was confirmed on more detailed subsequent investigation.
