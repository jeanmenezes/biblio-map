THINGS STAND OUTabout Thomas Tallis's career as a composer:
he experimented more regularly and more extravagantly than any of
his contemporaries; and he did what he was told. Since it goes against
current ways of thinking for creative artists to be subservient, I think we have
a conceptual problem with Tallis. Since he clearly did trim to the prevailing

TWO

political winds and quite possibly had a mild and undemanding character,
there is a tendency now to want to say he was suffering for his Catholicism
in bitter silence. This may be to take away from him a characteristic which
does seem really unusual, especially in so turbulent a century as the i6th in
England: a desire to push back boundaries of language and expression while
living a fulfilling life.
Both Tallis's experiments and his pliability were unusual in the context of
his time, though none of his contemporaries seems to have commented on
them. More recently there has been, if anything, an even greater silence
about him: a modern collected edition of his Latin church music still awaits
publication. One feels that if so apparently unremarkable a character and so
high-achieving an artist had been at work in any other field, academics would
have been falling over each other to find a new angle to illuminate the central
contradiction. And it is not just that he lived a long time ago. The Venetian
painter Giorgione, for example, died at about the time Tallis was born, but
partly because he was a painter in a city which has always drawn attention to
itself, and partly because his surviving work sometimes has the kind of
romantic quality people can't leave alone, experts have long been fighting
high-profile battles over what he did really do and why. Nor is it just that

John Milsom has more

in performingeditions.

Tallis was English: poets in 16th-century England never lack for interpretation. One only has to ask a question about any of Shakespeare's characters, no matter how minor, to be buried in literature arguing the point from
every angle. But to be both English and a musician has been disastrous for
Tallis in modern scholarship, as it has been for just about everybody similarly
circumstanced (except Taverner and, to a certain extent, Byrd).
It is not just that there is no full-length study of Tallis:' there has been no
debate about him at any level. It is still taken at face value, as it has been for
centuries, that he was an ardent Catholic who suppressed his instincts either
because he feared arrest or because he wanted a quiet life. Being an exceptional craftsman as well as an undemanding person, he therefore had no
trouble in more or less single-handedly inventing the child's-play Anglican
style, having learnt his trade doing something immeasurably more difficult.

It has been assumed that he didn't really want to do this, for both musical and
religious reasons, and that as soon as he could, with the re-establishment of
Catholicism in Mary's reign, he returned to the florid style with the kind of
relief felt by a pupil on being let out of school. It has further been assumed
that he remained faithful to the old religion with the same tenacity which
Byrd was to show all his life; his late works, which like Byrd's include sets of
Lamentations,being full of references to the unhappy state of a people which
has lost its way. However, unlike Byrd, he successfully kept this to himself
and the fact that he lived to be 80 years of age is generally taken as proof that
he must indeed have lived, as he died, 'in mild and quiet sort' to which his
tomb-stone in St Alfege's Church in Greenwich once testified. Meanwhile
no proper attempthas been made to place the achievement of Gaudegloriosa
or Spem in alium or even If ye love me in a proper context, either European
or within the gamut of renaissancethought. In many ways, therefore, we still
find ourselves at the pioneering stage when considering both Tallis and his
achievement.
of the problems for the would-be modern biographer of Tallis,
searching for clues to his real character,is that most of his music was
written for a Catholic Church which didn't ask its composers to express anything more tangible than a kind of luminous joy in the contemplation of eternal things. Such music can give little clue as to the personality
or emotional make-upof its composer in a modern sense. However, there can
be no doubt that its limited demands suited Tallis perfectly well. The music
he wrote for the Catholic monarchs Henry VIII and Mary has a fluency to it
which suggests a mind fully at ease with its circumstances. In these years
Tallis showed that he had, along with Palestrinabut few others, the ability to
write joyful music; to set texts with a positive message convincingly. Every
indication is that he was content to be writing to the limits of his technical
ability, in a style ill-equipped to express overt emotion, safe within the Catholic world of his fathers. A number of his colleagues seem to have been
similarly content: Taverner, Sheppard,Tye, William Mundy among them.
It was Tallis'sbehaviour in EdwardVI's reign which set him apart. Unlike
Taverner,who seems to have stopped composing for whatever reason, or Tye,
who became a Protestant cleric, or Sheppard, who lost his muse and died
young, or the new Protestants like Causton and Farrantwho appeared from
nowhere and as quickly disappearedagain, Tallis quickly adaptedto the new
Protestant circumstancesand simply carriedon, without obvious complaint.
This is the crux of the matter: he did not stand out for one religion or the
other, as Tye did at the time and Byrd would later do, nor does the Protestant
music he wrote show any sign of unease. He still was not required to
demonstrate emotion in his writing, merely to set texts according to certain
ONE

more-or-less defined principles. It is my reading that he did this willingly. It
could be argued that he was merely being the perfect artisan, plying a trade
to the best of his ability while hating it; but one cannot help noticing that
everyone else, potentially equally good craftsmen, got too involved and
eventually failed as artists.Tallis was able to keep his mind clear and produce
great music.
The main argument in favour of Tallis being an emotional man who
wanted to pour his suffering into his art comes from the music he wrote in
Elizabeth I's reign. To put this in perspective, we hear more of this music
today than of his earlierwriting, apartfrom one or two Edwardiananthems,
partly because it is more overtly expressive and partly because it tends to be
scored more suitably for the modern SATB choir. However, it only makesup
a part of the whole picture - not as great a part as we might think - and in
greatly changed circumstances. Nor is it all penitential. The two psalmmotets, Laudate dominumand Domine quishabitabit,for example, are rarely
performed but exemplify the Flemish techniques Tallis was adopting just as
well as the much-performed Lamentations sets. Finally, against the idea that
he, possibly like Taverner and Tye, had come to regret the whole tenor of his
life and wanted to make amends, is the evidence of his will. There he wrote:
'First I bequeath my soule unto Allmightie god our Lorde and Saviour Jesus
Christ the onely Redemer of the worlde'. This was hardly the language of a
man who had spent his life wrestling with a terrible truth. Byrd, on the other
hand, who clearly had so wrestled, wrote in his will: 'And that I may live and
dye a true and perfect member of his Holy Catholycke Church without
which I believe there is noe Salvation for me.' Without meaning to play down
the power of his last works, maybe there were straightforward, mundane
reasons for Tallis's partial change of tone. It is certain, for example, that he
was surroundedby younger composers who were trying out darkertexts for
the first time, suggesting that this experiment appealed to their listeners, including Elizabeth, who in turn may have been reacting against the certainties
being promoted by the warring churches. Amongst these younger men was
William Byrd, perhapskeen to show his master a new way, in an idiom which
required some consistency of thought between them since they had to
publish the fruits of their labours together. The Flemish imitative style, still
fairly new on the English scene, had always lent itself better to contemplation
than to more positive texts (Tallis's psalm-motets are disappointingly tame).
He may anyway have felt that he had said all he had to say in a joyful style,
many years earlier. And then, once again, he found that the tools at his
disposal suited him. He relished the opportunities inherent in the imitative
style, especially what happens when imitation is allowed to lose its usually
rigid tonal control. In the end Tallis'spenitential music is highly emotive, but
ultimately it is not as passionate as Byrd's. Tallis is enjoying himself too

much with the possibilities of language, even in the Lamentations,to appear
as an out-and-out emotional militant and lose himself in complaint. It is like
looking at a Bellini when, hanging nearby, is a Titian or a Michelangelo;
which is not to say that many people might not prefer to spend time with the
Bellini.
Tallis does indeed come over as a man of mild sort, who was happiest
making experiments,pushing out the frontiersof what he had inherited more
as a mathematical exercise than as a series of lessons in word-setting and
deeper meaning. Ironically a composer like Byrd didn't actually need to indulge in the same kind of pushing in order to express himself fully. By
intensifying the style which was already there, he had everything necessary
to write something as devastating as Civitassancti tui. He was looking inwards, which meant he didn't need to write 40-voice motets, or antiphons
which last 20 minutes. But if I'm right about what motivated Tallis, he must
indeed have been a happy man, because no-one has so fluently or relentlessly
asked questions of form and style. His solutions may have happened to end
up historically as culs-de-sac - how could anyone follow up on Spem?- but
as achievements in themselves they deserve far more profile than they have
received so far.
IN

SOME SENSE or other most of what Tallis wrote was breaking new

ground, and it would take the length of a book to do justice to it all. In the
discussion which follows I have preferred to judge the quality of his
music by the standards of absolute excellence, rather than from the more
usual 'whom was he influenced by and whom did he influence?' perspective.
If one adopts the latter approach, there is little space for Tallis's Latin music,
since the tradition effectively ended with him: in this way of judging him, his
Anglican music is vastly more significant, and indeed it has stolen much of
what limelight there has been for him. His Elizabethanwriting - which can
be seen as part of a continuum in developing the imitative style, itself later
to embrace many leading English composers like Gibbons and Tomkins - is
the next in line for the same reason. From this perspective Tallis's achievement appearsto dwindle as one looks back in time.
Taking each piece on its merits, the 40-part motet Spemin aliumrepresents
the tip of an iceberg. It is an achievement of the greatest magnitude, yet it is
typically discussed in almost parochial terms: for example, that it was not an
achievement which stood alone, but one which was set up by an earlier composer, Alessandro Striggio, in his 40-part motet Ecce beatamlucem, a piece
Tallis probably knew and hoped to rival. This is true, but the emphasis is
wrong. What deserves to be said is that there are very few monuments to intellectual thought in the whole range of composed music as staggering as
Spem. The Striggio isn't in the same hemisphere; Bach'sArt of fugue is; and

if it is thought worth spending time talking about and analysing the Art of
fugue, so also should it be thought worth analysing Spem. It is not that an
analysis of the Art of fugue will teach us anything about Spem:it is that out
of such attempts to pinpoint genius myths are made, and out of myths come
reputations and the desire for performances.
And Spem is by no means the whole story. Nor is Gaudegloriosa, though
that inevitably comes next on the list (ex.I). There are many earlierexamples
of what Gaudegloriosaset out to achieve, some by Tallis himself, most by his
greatest predecessors. The votive antiphon had been the jewel in the crown
of English composition for many decades before Tallis's first essays in the
form, but in Gaudegloriosa he significantly expanded it. This is not a comment about sheer length - at 17 minutes it is uncommonly long, though his
earlier Salve intemeratais slightly longer - but about breadth of conception
and the technique required to convey it. The melodies are longer and more
graceful than before, they fit together better, resulting in a grander sweep of
phrase, the scoring is more varied and impressive, especially in the double
gimell, and the ranges are more taxing. The stamina required from the singers to do justice to this masterpiece- not least when Tallis asks his top part to
reach an almost unprecedented high A at written pitch in the closing moments - is of a quite different order from any earliercomposition of this type.
I still have yet to hear a completely convincing live performance of Gaude
gloriosa. It is as if Tallis, like Beethoven in his Ninth Symphony, simply
would not be constrained by human considerations. The fact that William
Mundy went on to write something just as impressive as Gaudegloriosain his
Voxpatriscaelestis- in effect an extraordinaryone-off - should not diminish
our respect for his model. Anyway, with the death of Queen Mary,it was culde-sac time for the whole genre.
I

WOULD ALSO CONTEND that If ye love me and several of the other

anthems which Tallis wrote in Edward's reign deserve to be similarly
admired both as successful experiments and as first-rate conceptions in
their own right. In their case they are of the first historical importance too. It
is impressive that without them the whole Anglican church music project
would have been so impoverished in its initial stage that it is hard to imagine
how the thread would have been picked up again in Elizabeth's reign, when
the business of creating a complete repertoire of appropriatesettings had to
be undertaken in greater earnest. The Edwardian scene was otherwise unpromising, propped up by older composers like Tye and Sheppardwho were
obviously feeling their way with the new idiom, alongside younger, more
minor figures who believed in the doctrinal changes but who had little
experience as composers. Richard Farrant's Call to remembranceis an
effective piece, but it sounds stilted alongside Tallis's Hear the voice and

timeless: not only did they give a stylistic starting-point to Anglican
composers from the i6th century through to the i9th (for instance in the
anthems of someone like John Goss) but they have been performed without
break in the English cathedralsfrom Tallis's day to our own. The Third Tune
for Archbishop Parker's psalter - Why fum 'th in fight - inspired Vaughan

Williams to write a fantasia around it. Yet here was a style fashioned out of
wreckage, in an atmosphere of fear.
A full study of Tallis's innovations would refer to the seven-voice canon
Miserere
nostri,which for sheer mathematicalingenuity has been equalled (by
Bach amongst others) but scarcely outdone (ex.2). (The question with
canons is not only how clever they are, but how expressive. Did Tallis know
he would create this precise atmosphere when he started to plan all those
inversions and augmentations?) It would refer to the Missa Puer natus, with
its archaic use of very long-note chant coupled to a quite modern use of
rapidly overlapping motifs, the two together resulting in a motion which
resembles that of the penny-farthing - one element turning very slowly
while the other races by. That particularcombination, and the mood which
comes from it, is unique to this setting. Then it would be necessary to analyse
the way the first set of Lamentations,Derelinquat
impiusand Injejunioetfletu,
to mention only three, wander about tonally to give the sensation of being
lost. This too was a Tallis invention, which in Injejunio especially produces
something out on its own.
And in a sense those are only the obvious candidates, taken from Tallis's
last period. To gauge how original he was being in the less glamorous forms
of the Catholic hymn and respond poses a different challenge. Pieces such as
Candidifacti sunt, Dum transissetsabbatum,Euge caeli porta, Homo quidam
Jam Christusastra
fecit coenam,Honor virtus et potestas, Videte miraculum,
ascenderat
andJesu salvatorseculi have more or less vanished from cathedral
and concert listings, as has the surrounding repertoirewhich would show us
by comparison exactly what Tallis was trying to achieve. It is as if the performing tradition of his music leads to one set of conclusions about him,
while the surviving corpus taken as a whole promotes another. According to
Paul Doe's listing in Tallis, there are 18 Latin-texted pieces by Tallis from
Elizabeth's reign, as against 28 from the earlierperiods; and eleven of the 18
were published in the 1575CantionesSacrae,which ensured their survival in
a way not available to the earlier material.
These figures lend weight to the caution I feel about thinking that late
Tallis sums him up. Unlike most composers in the history of music he was
not allowed to develop a style which matured over his career as a composer,
which adds to the difficulty of finding what motivated him. A consistent
stylistic framework can provide a useful yardstick. With Tallis we have to

remained active throughout the entire period under consideration. Everybody of his generation, the one before it and the one after it either didn't
contribute to one style or the other for confessional reasons, or died before
reaching old age: John Taverner, John Merbecke, Christopher Tye, Robert
Johnson, John Sheppard,the several Parsons, Robert White, William Mundy

William Fox, William Whitbroke, Osbert Parsley (also something of an exception, though his music is second-rate) and several anonymous composers

Elizabeth's reign, and continue into the I7th century. What it took in terms
of stamina and personality to survive and excel as Tallis did, in the times he
did, has something of a miracle about it. But, looked at superficially,hunkering down, blotting out and keeping going come what may, is not a glamorous
activity.
