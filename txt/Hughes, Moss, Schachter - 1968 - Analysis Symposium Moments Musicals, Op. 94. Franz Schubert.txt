MATT HUGHES
A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSISt
Through the creative thoughts of various musicians and mathematicians, the quantitative approach in analysis has cultivated
the premise to an area in musicological
thought which has yet
to be either exposed or expressed in its entirety. Since the inception into this area of "quantitative musicology",
the wise
researcher is one who recognizes its many limitations in some
respects, and, at the same time, realizes its almost boundless
in other respects.
As the technique is conceived

The author wishes to express
his gratitude to Hans Heinz
Draeger, Professor in the Music Department of the University
of Texas at Austin, for the encouragement and many helpful
suggestions in the preparation of this article.

the benefit of the musician; and, therefore, it foregoes the complexities of mathematics to find its foundation in simple mathematics. Because the nature of this type of analysis appears to
be perplexing to many musicians,
a necessary portion of this
paper will have to be devoted to the analytical procedure, in
addition to discussing the results of this technique.
The objectives of this first procedure may be stated quite simply: (1) After counting the notes with its duration, some notes

important tone elements in terms of the circle of fifths, the
wider the distance in steps of the circle of fifths and the greater
the number of statistically
important notes, the more complex
is the tonal orientation of the composition.
What is advantageous is that tonality may be expressed in terms other than
functional; this mathematical precision can be invaluable. *1;
(2) The other result is called tonal orientation, a term adopted
to differentiate between it and tonal organization.
Analysis of

organization is an analysis of chords, progressions,
and periods in their mutual relationships.
Orientation is at no
time a chord-by-chord
analysis but is a result of the total occurrence of each note and its durational value. This phenomenon is expressed in the statistically
important notes discussed
in the first result and is understood to be the over-all tonality
or tonal orientation of a composition.
This condensation of important notes or tonal orientation could reveal that a composition in C major, for example, was in reality tonally oriented
toward G major, a consequence of semantic salience. *2
This technique is no more than a tool for the researcher.
At
no time is it meant to be a substitute for critical intellectualization.
Rather, it is a tool for organizing data so that one
may more discernibly view tendencies and interassociations.
Analysing the piano preludes of Skriabin, this tool proved to be
successful. *3
Turning to the music, Schubert has divided this composition
into five parts (Measures 1-8; 9-29; 30-37; 38-58; and 59-65).
The tempo of the composition is marked Moderato and the meter
signature is 3. The division of the beat is basically simple but
Schubert chooses to enhance the playful character of the melody

either a convex or concave shape. The minor sign or concave
shape indicates a tendency towards 100% information; and the
100% redundancy, is
tendency toward its opposite extreme,
represented by the plus sign or convex shape. This result is
derived from the series by a sequence of three steps or more
in either an increasing or decreasing direction.
The two numbers at the poles of the complexity are then added together and
the arithmetic mean is found. Then the number between the
poles is subtracted from the mean. If this number is smaller,
the result is closer to 100% information; thus, a minus sign is
placed before the result. If the number is larger than the mean,
the result is given a plus sign to indicate its tendency towards
100% redundancy.

tions, a comparison with different types of scales, patterns,
tone rows, or chords is valuable.
Step 3a: Barring the correct computation of notes, the following steps in this series of consequential events are perhaps the
most important.
First, the notes above the arithmetic mean
are given their corresponding numbers in the circle of fifths. *6
This approach is achieved by a numbering of the letters in the
circle of fifths from d66 to b$. The notes are counted in the
following manner:

Step 3c: In this portion of Step 3, one is counting numerical
distances between 11 and 18. Breaking the preceding example
into more detail, there are: seven 1-distance relationships
(11-12, 12-13, 13-14, 14-15, 15-16, 16-17, 17-18); six 2-distance relationships (11-13, 12-14, 13-15, 14-16, 15-17, 16-18);
five 3-distance relationships (11-14, 12-15, 13-16, 14-17, 1518); four 4-distance relationships (11-15, 12-16, 13-17, 14-18);
three 5-distance relationships (11-16, 12-17, 13-18); two 6distance relationships (11-17, 12-18); and one 7-distance relaThis situation is unchangeably true in every

"non-final" are not to be confused with satisfying and unsatisfying musical endings. From a psychological point of view, a

The retransition to the Da Capo (mm. 59-66) is fairly routine,
de-tonicizing (if one may use such a word) G major, just as
was done with D major previously.
In fact, these eight measures are so much less interesting than the others, one is tempted to picture Schubert already thinking of the next piece. That
would explain the mechanical recapitulation of the opening section which follows.
Concluding, I would like to go back to the symmetrical arrangeThe following diagram

Of course, one could think of the second section of (A) as being

he does in Moments Musicaux No. 4, right before the Trio.
That he didn't makes me wonder whether in fact he was aware
not only of the symmetries in the overall structure but even of
the relative proportions of the subsections.
The reader will
have noticed by now, of course, that I am referring to the Fibonacci series, each of whose numbers is the sum of the preceding two. This is evidenced not only by the eight and thirteen
measure durations, but by the overall length of twenty-one
measures for each second section (b + a'). One feature of the
Fibonacci series is that adjacent numbers approximate the
famous Golden Mean of medieval and Renaissance art:

The suggestion of a minor in mm. 9-10 is too brief and inconclusive to be considered a decisive departure from tonic harmony. In order to understand the contents of these measures
we must remember that they follow the extensive tonic elaboration of mm. 1-8. Viewed in this context the al of m. 9 reveals
itself to be the upper neighbor of the persistent inner-voice
tone gl of the opening phrase. The g 1 (in the foreground part
of the V of a minor) functions as a chromatic passing tone leading again to gl in m. 11 (see Example 3). The origin of this
inner-voice motion lies in the fleeting neighboring progression
caused by the grace note of m. 1. This connection may seem
forced, and it would be if this were the only instance of simiBut the use of al as neighbor to gl becomes a most

12. In a more conventional piece this g might well function as
a dominant of high structural order paving the way for the tonic
of the a' section.
Here, however, the g constitutes a brief
departure to the upper fifth, pointing back to the initial tonic
but not fated to usher in the recapitulatory one.
The melody of mm. 9-10 begins with the structural top-voice
tone e2, the grace note echoing the f2 of m. 7. However the
change of chordal position at the third beat of m. 9 brings to
the fore the inner-voice
tone c2. For the rest of the phrase
the right-hand part exploits the inner voice region (note, however, the recollection of e2 in m. 12, preceded by the diminished fifth bl-f2 as in the cadence of mm. 7-8). The melody

view of the motivic reference it provides.
The d2 in parentheses in Example 6 represents the underlying melodic tone
substituted for and bypassed in the actual piece.
THE B PART
If the reader will play through the first part of the piece he will
discover that it stands on its own and makes musical sense
apart from the piece as a whole. If he tries the same experiment with the second part (mm. 30-58) he will find that it cannot stand alone; its meaning becomes clear only in the context
of the whole piece.
The reason is the following:
The first
part expresses a complete musical thought leading, both in the
melody and harmony, to a stable conclusion on the tonic. The
G major section, on the other hand, never reaches a definitive
conclusion in the melody; the top voice, as we shall see, remains centered on d2.

The
contents of mm. 34-37 are pretty straightforward and my analysis should be clear from Example 8.
Measures

38-50

Example 9 explains the b section with its extended prolongation
of the V of G. Note the persistent use of A1 as fifth of the Dchord below the functional bass; in m. 45 the rising third A1B1-C adds the seventh to the chord (cf. the right-hand part of
m. 32). A passing motion within the V leads to the G of m. 51;
the bass progression echoes, in a differing harmonic context,
in low register,
and in broadened time values, the right hand
part of m. 36 and can possibly be traced back to the filled-in
fourths of mm. 4 and 5. Example 10 concerns a detail, the
contrapuntal background of the melodic dialogue of mm. 38-41.
Measures

51-58

The a' section (mm. 51-58) is the same as mm. 30-37 except
for the minor coloration of the first phrase.
This, of course,
is in marked contrast to the C major part where the recapitulatory section shows a structural function very different from
that of the opening one. We can therefore dispense with a graph
of mm. 51-58. Example 11 offers two reductions of the entire
underB part and indicates thatthe neighboring figure gl-al-gl
lies the entire middle voice; d2, of course, acts as the sustained top-voice tone.
Measures

59-66

These measures contain the retransition to the reprise of the
A part. This section has a number of compositional tasks to
perform. It must accomplish a harmonic reorientation through
which G ceases to be a stable center and becomes an active
element pointing to and demanding the reappearance of C. This
is accomplished here in the most usual fashion, by means of
the seventh, ftl (mm. 63-66). In addition the melody must prepare the lower register of the beginning of the A' part; this is

part. Schubert solves the structural problems, but in a somewhat perfunctory and unimaginative way; I, for one, find the
obvious sequential elaboration of the descending fifth (and the
persistent rhythmic repetition) rather hard to take. The one
