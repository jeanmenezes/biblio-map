PROBLEM

OF

DISSONANCE

by
Richard Bobbitt
Needham, Massachusetts
A primary function of music theory is the formulation of basic
concepts which will enable the student to understand more readily the
essential principles of composition.
Of the many problems that beset
the theorist, few are more pressing than the enigma of "consonance"
and "dissonance" - two words which are evidently the least understood
of any in the vocabulary of music.
Willi Apel notes that "no wholly
explanation and definition of consonance and dissonance
satisfactory
has yet been found" [1, articles "Consonance" "Dissonance"],
and Sir
James Jeans refers to the consonance phenomenon as "one of the unsolved problems of music" [15, 156].
The writer does not propose that the line of thought pursued in
this study be regarded as a panacea for the many controversies
that
have arisen from numerous attempts to account for the mystery of consonance and dissonance.
It is hoped, nevertheless,
that the observations presented here will be of value to the student who searches for
more concrete channels of inquiry than are commonly offered.
The acute need for clarification of the dissonance problem is seen
more clearly as we become aware of the lack of understanding on the
part of various writers who have dealt with the subject in more or less
detail. This is illustrated by the following commentaries,
among which
no general agreement
exists as to the exact meaning of the terms
"consonant" and "dissonant!'
According to Walter Piston [21, 6-7], consonant intervals are "the
perfect intervals and the major and minor thirds and sixths"; dissonant
intervals are "the augmented and diminished intervals and the major
and minor seconds, sevenths and ninths"' As an exception, the perfect
fourth is described as "dissonant when there is no tone below its lower
tone,' and "consonant when there is a third or perfect fifth below it"
Piston then emphasizes
that "the essential quality of dissonance is its
sense of movement and not, as sometimes
assumed, its

of Arnold Schonberg regard the atonal experiments
in which the "dissonant" intervals of seconds, sevenths, and tritones play a large role - as being particularly disagreeable);
(4)

the dissonant quality of an interval may depend upon its position in
a chord, and the same interval (e.g. perfect fourth) is therefore
considered to be both consonant and dissonant!

Ernst Toch, on the other hand, tells us that "no sound, considered
by itself and detached from any other context, can under any circumstances be other than neutral and meaningless...
To divide any kind of
sound, be it tones, intervals or harmonies, into one category of consonances per se- white sheep - and another one of dissonances per se black sheep - is as absurd as it would be to divide the letters of the

[29, 15]. Toch's view is

generally supported by Helmholtz [13, 227-8], who says that "from the
most perfect consonance tothe most decided dissonance there is a continuous series of degrees,
of combinations
of sound, which continually
increase in roughness, so that there cannot be any sharpline drawn between consonance and dissonance,
and the distinction would therefore
seem to be merely arbitrary ... the decision does not depend, then, on
the nature of the intervals themselves
but on the construction of the
whole tonal system''
But Helmholtz also notes that "any relation of
in small numbers is dissonant" [13,
pitch which cannot be expressed
331], thus completely reversing his earlier statement!
Musical consonance and dissonance are defined by Norman Cazden
to relations among harmonic aggre[7, 161] as "qualitative responses

culture" and G. Revesz also refers to the consonance-dissonance
phenomenon as the result of "esthetic evaluation" [24, 89]. But E. G. Bugg
observes [5, 17] that it is "a mistake to attempt to make the history of
the art of music the basis for a scientific
explanation of consonance";
and Apel tells us that "every interval contained in the major (or minor)
triad and its inversions
is a consonance, the other intervals are dissonances" [1, articles
"Consonance"' "Dissonance"], in spite of Toch's
insistence
[29, 12] that "in the light of light there are countless
shades of shade"

does not hesitate to classify the unison, octave, and perfect fifth as
"secondary" consonances [12, 20]1

THE PHYSICAL BASIS OF INTERVALLIC QUALITY
Again it should be evident that there is no general agreement as
to the exact musical meaning of the words "consonant" and "dissonant!'
The foregoing quotes, in spite of many discrepancies
and contradictions, are useful in that they clearly expose the nature of the dilemma.

(the

Theorists who favor the non-functional classification
of intervals
as consonant or dissonant, regardless
of context, usually make their
judgements on the basis of number ratios, beating phenomena, or fusion. These characteristics,
in turn, are assumed to account for various degrees of roughness-smoothness,
or pleasantness-unpleasantness.
Pythagoras proposed that sounds made by strings whose lengths are to
each other as 1:2: 3:4, are more pleasant when heard together than
sounds from strings whose relative lengths are expressed by larger
numbers 2[3, 69]; and Jean Philippe Rameau observed [g2, 5] that "the
order of the origin and perfection of consonant intervals is determined
by the order of the numbers" (in the natural harmonic series) - i.e.
the smaller the number ratios, the greater the consonance.
Many
acousticans
of the 20th century still adhere to the same ancient
in spite of the fact that the equally tempered fifth, which
premises,
cannot be distinguished by ear from the Pythagorean pure fifth, is approximately equivalent to the ratio 295:442 [J1, 7] - hardly a smallnumber relationship.
F. R. Watson, for example, tells us [30, 107]
that "two pure tones are harmonious and pleasing to the ear if the ratio
of their frequencies is made up of small numbers'
Helmholtz, in addition to his other theories of consonance, suggests that intervals are consonant if no "disturbing" beats are produced
by the two tones or their harmonics [13, 186ff], and then arranges the
various intervals in "order of smoothness"
[.3, 193]. Otto Ortmann,
however, states that "quality is a psychological reaction and has no independent physical component" [L2, 3].
Intervallic classification
according to the theory of "fusion" is
conducted by Carl Stumpf [28], who
chiefly the result of investigations
measured the consonance of intervals according to their tendency (to
the trained ear) to fuse together as a tonal unit (klang). Stumpf, in
direct contrast to Ortmann, did not feel that the smoothness,

Are we to regard consonance and dissonance as nonfunctional intervallic sonorities with varying degrees of "roughness" or
'"moothness" or do we consider them to be qualitative responses to
functional musical situations?
To continue the dualistic description of
consonant and dissonant intervals can hardly contribute to the growth
of music theory as a practical science.
Consonance and dissonance
should not be used to describe both functional and non-functional situations.
Surely, it borders on the ridiculous to tell a student that isolated
intervals may be classified
a priori as consonances and dissonances,
and then to declare that a dissonance is really nothing but an interval
which must "be followed by another harmony,
without
which the effect would be unsatisfactory
and incomplete"
Example 1. 25, 16]. According to the rule just stated, any interval
might be "dissonant" in function if it seemed to require
resolution and, if such be the case, why bother to categorically label every interval as consonant or dissonant?

Imagine the student's confusion when he is taught [25, 17;
J
20, 6] that the interval in Ex. 1 is consonant, but that the
interval in Ex. 2 is dissonant I
Example 2.
The usual explanation,
of course, is that the augmented fifth has a tendency to resolve upward, and that
this "leaning" towards resolution conveys an impression
of incompleteness
(and consequently,
dissonance) to the
ear. Is it not equally logical, however, to assume that
the minor sixth also could have a tendency to resolve
downward (e. g. IV6 - I in c minor), and that such a tendtoward resolution would demand that it, too, be classified as disency
sonant? The same reasoning applies to all intervals, since any interval
may be spelled enharmonically.

of course, will not disturb the air mass around it, but if force is applied so as to cause the object to change its spatial position, the resulting movement will act against the surrounding air particles and effect a
of these particles.
Such action produces an opposite recompression
action which continues until the original disturbance has dissipated, and
this alternation of molecular condensation and rarefaction constitutes
the phenomenon known as "vibration"
Air vibrations occurring at a
rate of about 16 to 40 times per second, or faster, stimulate the hearing response termed "sound!'

In other words, once an air particle is set in motion, elasticity

The continuum of transverse
motion shown in Diagram 2 is quite similar to the form of periodic
motion known as "simple harmonic motion"' and the latter may be illustrated by a "simple harmonic curve" (Diagram 3, p. 179).
A simple harmonic curve is elementary,
regular, symmetrical,
and is an instantaneous graphic representation
of the condition of motion in a simple wave [15, 12] - i. e. the distances AB or CD illustrate

The factors of "amplitude" and "periodicity;' as represented by a
simple harmonic curve, are particularly
important to this inquiry.
But in the study of intervals we are also concerned with amplitudeperiodicity relations between two or more tones, and it is necessary,
therefore, to comment briefly upon the source of interval ratios.
Air columns of relatively constant density, or strings of relatively constant tension, will produce composite vibration waves which
contain a fundamental, predominating tone, as well as other tones of

By referring to the harmonic series it is seen that ratios for all
of the intervals are readily available.
The interval of the octave, for
example, is formed by tones related as 1:2, and the fifth is seen to be
formed bythe ratio of 2:3. Ratios for the major third (4:5), minor third
(5:6), and major second (8:9) - and for any interval - are similarly

These waves are subjected to
reflection (by walls, floor, ceiling),
absorption (by drapes, carpets,
clothes of individual persons), interference (as the result of superposition of individual wave trains), and set up sympathetic vibrations within
the floor, seats, walls and ceiling of the hall. In addition, the orchestra
itself is actually composed of a mixture of tunings [3, 200]; in that the
piano and harp are tuned in equal temperament, the strings tend toward

tion. The listener, however, adjusts himself almost immediately to the
surrounding cacophony, and accepts the result as "a good performance"!
Situations of this kind point up the marvelous ability of the ear to
find a mean between extremes.
Compare, for example, the aural response to vibrato, an effect produced by rapidly fluctuating between
the adjacent pitches above and below a given fundamental tone. The
vibrato actually produces a whole family of tones of different pitch and
intensity [17, 215], and the apparent richness of vibrato is due to the
presence of these tones on either side of the central pitch [4, 24]. Oddly
vibrato does
enough, due to the ear's power of mean discrimination,
not obscure the pitch of the fundamental tone. If several tones of nearly
the same frequency (e.g. 600, 604, 608, 612, 616 c.p.s.)
and intensity
are sounded together, the resulting tone will be judged by the ear as
having a pitch which is the approximate mean of the highest and lowest
extremes [4, 24]. This fact and other similar phenomena have led the
writer to believe that the mean perception of pitch is the outstanding
feature of the ear's ability to discriminate between manifold acoustical
events.
Other characteristics
of tone such as intensity, duration, quality,
volume, and brightness are important; but these factors are of little
consequence if the listener is unable to perceive pitch. It seems safe
to assume that we are not concerned as much with how loud a tone is
sounded, or how long it is sustained by a single-or double-reed instrument, as we are with its location onthe musical staff. And, fortunately,
the first significant musical information that the ear transmits is evidently that of pitch-identity; other factors seem to be a secondary response.
Fletcher tells us [10, 61] that the subjective phenomenon which
we identify as pitch is the result of the objective stimulus, frequency.
In other words, when we identify pitch we are responding primarily to
an event or combination of events in the time-domain,

As noted earlier, the equal-tempered
fifth cannot ordinarily be
distinguished by ear from the Pythogarean fifth and, although the frequency ratio of the former is around 295:442, the aural response seems
to be identical to the one stimulated by the ratio 2:3. It is evident,
that the ear is able to accept the 295:442 ratio as a mean

of music would be impossible,
since no instrupractical performance
ment without a set tuning (e.g. keyboard instruments)
can be relied
upon to produce intervals which are perfectly adjusted according to the
ratios of natural (just) intonation.
Realistic theorists have known for
years that tuning is actually a system of compromise within a particular frame of reference [3, 197-9].
The above should not be construed as an acceptance of the "smallnumber theory" of consonance.
To demonstrate that the ear can perceive a mean approximation in small numbers between slightly mistuned intervals does not give us license to proclaim the consonance or
dissonance of such intervals.
To discover that two tones are related
as 3:4 or 221:295, or any other ratio, does not warrant their being
labeled as inherently consonant, since any interval can be forced into
a situation of imbalance and thus become dissonant.
The real importance of the foregoing, to this inquiry, is that the

From this point on the resultant repeats itself continuously

The same results may be obtained more simply as in Diagram 8
(p. 188), where the durational changes in amplitude level are shown for
3:2 and 4:3. Starting moments of the two wave trains will not affect the
over-all amplitude change patterns.
As illustrated in Diagram 9, the
waves begin to synchronize almost immediately.
The foregoing examples

subtractive aspects of wave superposition
yield a pattern of pressure
fluctuation that is directly related to the numerical periodicities
of the
superimposed waves. A wave of 300 c.p.s. against a wave of 200 c.p.s.
(i.e. 3:2) will produce changes in amplitude level.
The approximate
time-moments
between these amplitude changes are periodically
related as 2:1:1:2, and may be described as durational changes in amplitude level.
A wave of 400 c.p.s. against a wave of 300 c.p.s. (i. e. 4:3)

Such
durational changes in amplitude (intensity) level are directly proportional to the amount of particle activity in a perceivable
intervallic
area, and are regarded as variations in density.
An interval resulting from 300 c.p.s.
against 200 c. p.s. is consequently less "dense" than one resulting from 400 c. p. s. against 300
c. p. s., because the former excites less activity than the latter. Pressure fluctuations periodically related as 2:1:1:2 are less turbulent than
fluctuations periodically related as 3:1:2:2:1:3 - i.e. the totalair mass

Relative density for the major sixth (5:3) and major third
(5:4) is computed in Diagram 10 (p. 189). The method is identical with
that shown in Diagram 6.
We are now ready to evolve a complete scale of absolute sonority

most outstanding:
(1) the intervallic ratio for the tritone does not occur in the first sixteen partials of the harmonic series as do the other interval ratios.
The proportions 5:7 or 7:10, contrary to popular opinion [14, 81-2],
do not evoke the interval response we know as the "tritone effect''
These proportions,
when sounded in pure tone by oscillators,
produce an effect which is unlike any interval among the first sixteen
harmonics, but observers who have actually heard such an experiment5 in the laboratory are aware that the aural response is not

THE PHYSICAL BASIS OF INTERVALLIC QUALITY
Beating - the interference phenomenon heard as minute intensifications of sound at regular periods - is an important factor in intervallic perception, being a characteristic
feature of the high-density intervals in Group 3. It has also been noted, however, that beating is
not an objective phenomenon but a subjective one7; "it is only because
the two tones force into vibration two overlapping regions of the basilar
membrane that an alternate waxing and waning of sound is heard" [27,
the number of beats generated by an interval is
241]. Furthermore,
not constant in different registers.
There are only about 4 beats, for
example, between c" and db", but between c"" and db"" there are about
16 [31, 12, 16].
Beating, whether of fundamental tones or harmonic
partials, should not be confused with density.
between the density concept and "smallAlso, the distinction
number" theories of the past must be clearly understood.
The latter
held that tones whose frequencies
were related as "small numbers"
formed consonant intervals.
This use of the word "consonant' as we
have noted already, had no real significance
in functional music, and
to say that the ratio 1:2 produced a "smooth" interval did not show why
or how such an interval might be rougher or smoother than another.
The concept of density not only provides visual description of
relative complexitybut offers also a tangible
regardless of registerscale of intervallic relationships which can be used to establish a mean
rate of information exchange.
The fact that all intervals besides the
octave may be slightly mistuned and yet retain their essential identity
does not detract from the potential usefulness of the density scale. Althoughthe computation of intervallic complexity was necessarily worked
out in terms of ideal interval ratios, slightly mistuned intervals will
still retain the same relative degrees of complexity.
The reader is
reminded again of the ear's ability to discriminate
the mean relationin tuning and pitch ratios.
ship between discrepancies
Caution should be exercised
in applying the density concept to
intervals exceeding the octave. The true nature of the octave phenomenon in music does not yet seem to be understood clearly.
Revesz has
advanced the idea that the qualitative equivalence of tones an octave
apart is due to their "phenomenological
similarity"
[.4, 61] -i.e.
there is "something" about tones separated by one or more octaves that
makes them appear similar in quality, but not identical (contrary to
At any rate, the question has not been settled as to
popular belief).
whether an eleventh, for example, is perceived as an intervallic unit
(Gestalt) or as a perfect fourth by instantaneous octave adjustment.
It
is the writer's opinion that the latter states the case accurately since
any interval, say a major seventh, can be made to sound like an octave
duplication (on first impression)
simply by sounding the two tones sufficiently far apart. An interesting experiment is related by Schillinger
[26, 699] wherein trained musicians were unable to distinguish between
short fragments of Grieg's Peer Gynt Suite played at the unison, and

the ear judges intervals exceedin&the octave in terms of its familiarity
with intervals within the octave, and musical situations evaluated in
terms of the latter will have essentially
the same perceptual, if somewhat "distilled:' effect.
Therefore,
density patterns within the octave
are assumed to be adequate for the majority of musical problems.

relationships
The density scale does not assort the intervals according to their consonance or dissonance, but offers criteria for the analysis and synthesis
of functional intervallic
relations according to context.
Let us remember that consonance and dissonance in this study are regarded as
functional combinations of tones which respectively stimulate responses
of stability or instability.
An individual's reaction to observable phenomena, acoustical or
otherwise,
may be examined more readily with the help of a scale of
measurement
known as the Mean Rate of Information Exchange (RIE),
which provides a general method for describing the relation between
under-stimulation
and over-stimulation.
In music, for example, communication between the composer and listener might never be established if the latter received either too little or too much information
from a particular composition.
A highly complex piece of music might
leave eventhe well-trainedlistener
in a state of confusion and aesthetic
and an absurdly simple composition might elicit from the
frustration,

of boredom.

between these two extremes

or "appreciation"
wherein the trained
"knowledgeable

he is able to perceive the composer's general intentions.
This area of
"normal" response is not unlike the point of balance which Heraclitus
felt existed between the action of opposites.

It is in the above-indicated
"normal" area that, as Cazden puts it
[, ix], "the content of the music must be communicated somehow in its
tangible sounding performance"; also it is with the aid of this terminology that music from various periods may be described objectively,
without resorting to conflicting definitions.
One might speak, for example, of a compositional style as being disturbing due to its extremely
complex RIE or, perhaps, as being pleasing due to its balanced and
relatively normal RIE. An objective method of controlling or evaluset is available through
ating the potential RIE of a given intervallic
the use of the density scale.
A too-rapid rate of information exchange
might very correctly be described as dissonant, since the reference
would be to a disturbing functional situation.
Again, however, no interval in isolation should be called consonant or dissonant but, rather,
should be referred to as having "low density"' "medium density" or
"high density" and therefore as being potentially stable or unstable.
A contrapuntal situation involving low-density
intervals
from
Group 1 is shown in Ex. 6 (p. 196). The RIE (rate of information exdue to the comchange) in this example borders on under-stimulation
intervals which would tend

Compare Ex. 6 with Ex. 7 which uses highalmost exclusively.
The RIE in Ex. 7 borders on

over-stimulation
due to the almost complete absence of medium- and
intervals which would tend to add elements of repose.
A
low-density
mean balance between the above extremes canbe obtained by using freor by combining low, medium, and
intervals

area of normal response due to the balanced use of low- and mediumdensity intervals, in combination with a smaller number of high-density
intervals.
Scoring, dynamics, and various coloristic devices can be used to
obscure the simplicity-complexity
relations of intervallic
areas, but
the density scale furnishes a generally concrete approach to the analysis
of consonant-dissonant
situations.
Note how the consonant (balanced)
effect of Ex. 9 (p. 197) is abruptly disturbed by the sudden and unwarranted insertion of a high-density
interval in m. 5, thus producing a
dissonant (unbalanced) response at that point. Yet, the same chordstructure fails to evoke a dissonant response if it occurs in a different

No interval, therefore,
can be termed consonant or dissonant
without consideration of context; but this does not pliminate the classification of isolated intervals,
since now we can evaluate them in terms
of their relative density and actually visualize their probable tendency
toward under-stimulation
or over-stimulation.
The similar quality of inverted intervals is also explained by the

An interval is said to be inverted when the frequency of its lower

Assume, for example, that the two intervals in question were the
perfect fifth and its inversion, the perfect fourth. By referring to the
density scale in Table I (p. 191), it is seen that the periodic complexity
pattern of the fifth is 2112; of the fourth, 312213. The frequency ratio
of the latter is 3:4 (C. P. = 12); that of the former, 2:3 (C. P. - 6). The
fourth, therefore, having the largest common product, contains integers in its density pattern (Ex. 11, p. 199) which result from a summation of terms (in brackets) in the density pattern of the fifth. The same
holds true for all other intervals and their inversions.
Ex. 12 illustrates the numerical relationship between the major third and minor
sixth. Note that numbers in the periodic pattern of the minor sixth are
either duplicates or the result of summed terms fromthe major third's
density pattern.
The significance of this seemingly abstract analogy should not be
overlooked by the reader.

and that these events may
due to coincident events in the time-domain,
be described in terms of numerical relationships
between density patterns of the intervals.
The inextricable bond of periodic complexity between an interval
and its inversion is further evidenced by displacing the density pattern
of any interval in simultaneity
from its axis of symmetry (start with
that position whose ratio yields the largest common product).
The resulting periodicity corresponds
identically to the inversion of that interval (Diagram 11).
The potential tendency towards stability of all types of chordstructures may be evaluated by means of the density scale. The reader
is reminded again, however, that the roughness caused by beating has
nothing to do with the density theory per se. The diminished-7th chord,
for example, contains no intervals that "beat' but still has a pronounced
forward tendency to move to another harmony due to the presence of

stability of all intervallic
sonorities is based on the following principle: structures with the higest density rating will have the strongest tendency toward instability.

as low

and the tritone as a special case.

Group 1 intervals are given a rating of 1;

The density ratings of various structures
may be obtained easily by
for
using the above classification.
Among the 3-part (3p) structures,
example, the four common types of triads8 would be rated as follows:
S5 maj:

contains 1 interval from Group 1 and 2 from Group 2.
Density rating = 5

S5 min:

contains 1 interval from Group 1 and 2 from Group 2.
Density rating = 5

S5 aug:

Density rating = 6

from Group 2.

S5 dim:

contains 2 intervals

from Group 2 and one from Group 4.

denotes a triad built in thirds; S7, a 7th chord built in thirds; S9, a 9th
chord built in thirds.

Observe thatthese ratings correspond tothe traditional treatment
of the above triads - i. e. the augmented triad is considered less stable
than the major or minor, and the diminished triad is the least stable of
all due to its high density rating. Ratings for the 7th chords (S7) and
9th chords (S9) are derived in the same way. Table IN (p. 201) shows
comparative density ratings for triads, 7ths and 9ths. To avoid confusion in terminology,
these structures
are shown below Table III in
musical notation. The number above each chord is its density rating.
The same principle applies to progressions

from Group 2, and only one from Group 3, whereas the third chord
contains two intervals from Group 3. Since the latter chord has more
Group 3 intervals than the former, it is considered to be less stable,
even though the overall density rating for both structures is the same.
The general rule for comparing chords with the same rating is as follows: When two or more structures have the same density rating, that
structure containing the most intervals from the group with the highest
density rating will'have the strongest tendency towards instability.
In Ex. 14 (p. 203) there are several chords with the same rating.

Group 3 intervals as B and C. There is no change in stability between
chords G and H since both these structures have the same kinds of intervals from the same Groups - i. e. each has a perfect fourth, major
sixth, two major thirds, a minor sixth, and a minor second.

Pressure
changes resllting from molecular compression variations are brought about by the tremulous motion of material objects,
which causes a displacement of air particles.
This action results in an
alternation of particle condensation
and rarefaction
constituting the
phenomenon known as vibration, and the hearing response to vibratory
motion is termed sound. Regular air vibrations with a speed of around
16 to 40 times per second and faster may be perceived as pitch; the
sensation of interval is produced by combining two or more pitches.
The amplitude-periodicity
between

two tones may be established by examining the points in time where no
reinforcement
or cancellation exists between wave trains, and between
which points all pressure fluctuations take place that produce patterns
of change in particle activity.
These patterns, reflecting the intensity
of molecular activity in a perceivable
intervallic
area, provide the
means for measuring the relative density of such an area, thus paving
the way for a scale of absolute intervallic sonority.
The density scale, which does not vary appreciably with register
or intensity (as do beats and combination tones), offers visual evidence
of the probable tendency of the intervals towards stability or instability.
The medium-density
thirds and sixths of Group 2, serving as a convenient mean between extremes,
have provided a relatively stable
foundation for most of the music in Western civilization
(especially
since c. 1450). The unprecedented
popularity of these intervals is
evidenced by many rules of traditional theory, one of the more interesting of which is the principle that thirds and sixths are the only intervals permitted to move in parallel motion in strict counterpoint

the high-density
