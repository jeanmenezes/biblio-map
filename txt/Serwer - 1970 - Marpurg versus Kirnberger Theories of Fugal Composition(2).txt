Marpurg expanded on his comments
he referred
to the tendency of some

232
composers to be affected by modal thinking. He admitted that
Mattheson was correct in saying that no text book forbids a
reversal of subject and answer but claimed that even this lack
of a prohibition is based on modal thinking. He observed that
he himself thinks in terms of "our present day keys"*53 which
require a clearly defined relationship between the tonic and the
key of the fifth above. Even the two long notes that begin the
subject do not sufficiently define the key. For example, some

old style had few if any episodic passages,
whereas in modern
works they were a necessity.
However, he never quite said in
so many words that the lack of episodic material in old fugues
was consistent with the nature of modal composition in which
tonal areas were not clearly defined and were rarely contrasted
with one another. Such works did not need transitional or modulatory material to lead the ear from one key area to another.
"Modern" fugues called for procedures that defined tonal centers as clearly as possible and at the same time presented a
number of different aspects of the tonic key. Marpurg's insistence on such variety helps us define the fugues of J. S. Bach
as modern in contrast to the simpler tonal plan of typical works
of such predecessors
as Dietrich Buxtehude.

den Rameau- und Kirnbergerschen Grundbass (Breslau: J. F. Korn, 1776). It

See The Well-Tempered Clavier, II, fugues number 11 (F major) and 15 (Gmajor). Emanuel Bach's fugue is listed in Alfred Wotquenne, Thematisches Verzeichnis der Werke von Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach (Leipzig: Breitkopf &
Hartel, 1905), p. 52, item X, 119, no. 6. For the fugue by Handel, see Hallische
Handel Ausgabe, Series II, vol. 1: Die achte grosse Suiten, ed. Rudolph Steglich (Kassell: Barenreiter-Verlag,
1955), pp. 73-75. This fugue is part of the
suite in F major first published in London in 1720.

23

Allegro, p. 8. Kirnberger might well have argued that even if Marpurg was
correct and six-four harmonies existed at the points in question, they could be
considered essential dissonances that may occur on weak or strong beats with
or without preparation. Furthermore such eighth-note passages in rapid tempo
suggest relatively free treatment. It should also be noted, however, that this
discussion took place in 1759-1760, some twenty years before Kirnberger published his own works on music theory. See Mekeel, p. 180.
