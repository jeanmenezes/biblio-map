scale as an entity which can be examined on its own terms,
which can be compared and eventually fused with diatonic

Such an admittance of the chromatic scale to the
company of musical materials should not be difficult, for the
scale has been with us for many generations.
Chromaticism in its most inclusive and persistent meaning, is
the relationship established by practice between the organizing
powers of the diatonic system and diffusive features of the
chromatic scale. Some of the simplest forms of chromaticism

The uniform pattern of the chromatic scale leads to opposite
results.
Each tone forms a set of intervals identical with that

In the diatonic system, as illustrated in Example 1, there is
only one diminished fifth, B to F, along with its inversion, the
tritone, F to B. The normal diatonic half step progression of
this interval as it moves to C-E (or E-C), illustrated in Example 4, has a marked tendency to establish C as a center of
tonal orientation, thus giving it the status of a tonic degree.
But the fixing of the tonic degree, fixes the relation to it of all
other diatonic tones. All become "degrees'' for each has not
only a unique character, but also a unique position with relation to a tonal center.
Thus, it is possible to impart to a tone
the character of a degree in the diatonic system.
Further, it
is possible to move from one such recognizable degree to another. These two diatonic functions, Degree Identification and
are basic for our study.

Here too the chromatic scale presents an opposite situation.
A diminished fifth and an enharmonically
related tritone can
be built from each of the twelve tones. Even if the behavior of
these intervals is restricted to the diatonic "key defining" progression, two mutually exclusive results follow, as illustrated
in Example 5a. Further, since this dualism is transposable to
all tones, as suggested in Example 5b, a prime
ordering force

of diatonicism becomes a dispersing force of the chromatic
scale.
Thus, where each degree of the diatonic major scale
is imbued with a single meaning, due to its characterizing interval set and its distance from a tonic degree, the tones of
the chromatic scale have multiple meanings;
for none is
separable from the others by its interval set, hence none has
an inherent, prior right to the status of a tonic degree.
The
assumption is sometimes made that the first or last tone of a
chromatic series is the tonic degree, or that the completion of
the octave cycle is an orienting factor, or that degrees are
determined by absolute pitch levels.
None of these desiderata
rests on inherent faculties of the chromatic scale.

Because scales are customarily thought of as melodic relationships, only a partial insight intotheir nature canbe gained.
Certainly, the scales of harmonically oriented music can be
represented
profitably in a harmonic pattern whereby the
several degrees, now representing roots of chords, are placed
a descending fifth or an ascending fourth apart, as in Example
6. Such a descending scale bears the same generic relationas the melodic form does to
ship to harmonic progressions
melodic progression.
Observe in Example 6 that the quality
of each triad is predetermined
by the available tones of the
scale. Of more basic significance is the fact that the directive
tritone, (indicated by black notes) now dispersed among several
chords, plays a critical role in directing the harmonic motion
toward the final tonic chord which, in fact, clears the air of
the tritone.
The structural nature of such a progression
is
apparent.

The Introduction of Chromatic

Elements

There are two ways in which chromatic elements appear in
diatonic textures, by Interpolation and by Replacement. Interpolation refers to those instances in which the chromatic half
step is introduced between diatonic tones, as in Example 8a.
Replacement occurs, often as an abbreviation of interpolation,
when a chromatic variant is substitutedfor a diatonic element,
as in Example 8b. Example 8c combines both in a single ilIt is of basic importance to recognize that all of
lustration.
these illustrations,
diatonic and chromatic, express the structure of C major, some in the boldest manner, the others enriched.
The Four Functions

of Chromaticism

The many ramifications
of interpolation and replacement are
classifiable
in terms of four functions, Degree Identification,
Degree Progression,
Degree Inflection, and Degree Transformation. Degree identification and degree progression
are of
diatonic origin and refer to factors of structural orientation
already discussed*4,
namely those that describe the components of a diatonic scale not merely as tones, but as characterized degrees bearing a determinable relationship to a tonal
center, the tonic degree.
Degree inflection is a function of chromaticism which bestows
identical meaning on chromatic variants of a given pitch name,
such as Db, D, and D#. Where pure diatonic functions are expressed only through a single pitch name for each degree,
chromaticism
has the power of inflecting a degree upward or
downward without sacrifice to its identity.
Thus the second
step of C major can retain its meaning as a second step progressing to a first step even though it is expressed as Db.
Similarly, in moving to the third step, D may be inflected to
D# and still represent a second step, as indicated earlier in

an aspect of the enharmonic relationDegree transformation,
ship, is a function of chromaticism whereby a given pitch may
express the meanings of more than one pitch name. Thus a
notated Cx, D, and Ebb represent different aspects and capabilities of the same pitch, assuming as always in a chromatic
music that equal temperament prevails (see Tuning, below).
In practice, two reasons can be found for the use of enharmonic notation. The first applies to those cases where a comdiverse and remote funcposer wishes to notate accurately,
tions of the same pitch, as in Example 10. Only this type of

The second reason, equally prevalent, relates to the practice
of notating in a simple or convenient form close relationships

Such relationships,
though simple,

otherwise require a complicated,
correct, notation. A simple illustration will suffice. Imagine
a composition in A major which, at one point, changing to A

Gb minor, and Cb major chords, all relatively unfamiliar in
appearance. An enharmonic notation makes it possible to present these in a manner more accessible
to the performer,
as
indicated in Example 1 lb.*5 In such cases degree transformation is not operative, for structure is in no way involved.
A related use of enharmonic notation, but as a necessary convenience, occurs as a result of one of the foibles of our system
of notation, the discrepancy betweenthe simple octave, and the
intervals spanned by twelve fifths, three major thirds, four
minor thirds, or six major seconds.
Twelve ascending fifths
from C lead to a B#, as do three ascending major thirds, six
ascending major seconds, and four descending minor thirds,

ascending minor thirds lead to Dbb, as in Example 12c. In
equal temperament all lead, in fact, to an octave and, byvirtue
of an enharmonic shift of convenience are so notated, as indicated in Example 12b and d. Here again, degree transformation is no part of this process, which calls upon enharmonic
notation simply as a convenience.
Finally, although degree transformation,
by its nature, represents an'enharmonic
change, the change itself is not always
notated. In Example 13a, the Bb at the end of bar one refers
to properties of the A chord; but as the tone proceeds to the B
chord of bar 2 it functions as an A# as in Example 13b (bars

which, successive
degrees in ascent are raised, and in descent, lowered, except that in descent it is customary to raise
the fourth degree rather than lower the fifth, as illustrated in
Example 14.

However, such a rule of the thumb is precisely
that, and
nothing more than a rough guide, for aside from the practical
advantage that it offers, of reducing close to the minimum the
number of required cancellation signs, it is basically arbitrary
and subject to constant modification.
Since the chromatic scale usually appears within a diatonic
frame of reference,
its notation varies with the underlying
model.

atic notation of convenience rather than one of presumed correctness is much to be preferred.
For example, in G# minor,
the chromatic filler between G# and A# is better notated as A

to the reader than Ebb. So long as the essential

Chords, as well as keys, exercise a formative influence on the
notation of chromatic passage work. An arresting case can be
found at the end of the introduction to Beethoven's
Sonata

changes to a seven-five-three,
evidently preferred not to alter, in descent, the fifth, D, of the
G chord.
Sometimes special factors play a determining role, as in the
case of Chopin's G# minor Etude, Op. 25 /6. Chopin was wisely

sharp variance in many places with chromatic scales as they
are usually notated in such a key as G# minor. Only at certain
critical cadences, near the end, does Chopin write a diminished
fourth, Fx to B, in order to represent the leading tone.
The problems connected with the notation of certain chromatic
from passage work within chords,
chords, as distinguished
seem to disturb composers less thanthose theoreticians whose
life work is evidently the naming of all chords in terms of
Roman numerals.
An interesting case presents itself in the
Andante of Beethoven's Piano Sonata, Op. 14/2, where a pasObserve in

relationship, A# also appears twice. From a harmonic theorist's point of view two of these must be wrong. From Beethoven's point of view, which is far more important, it would
seem that when he used full chords (the first and third times),
he preferred the Bb which suggests more directly the attributes of G, in the approaching cadence.

decisively clear diatonic model can act as a guide, or, second,
that the chromatic scale will be visiting its own native powers,
often ambiguous, upon the passage in question.
The core of
the problem is the occasional difficulty, even the impracticability, of distinguishing between the functions of degree identification and degree transformation,
such as the differences
in function between a D# and an Eb, on the one hand, and on
the other, between degree progression
(say, D# to E) and
degree inflection (Eb to E). For generalizing purposes it will
suffice to establish an order of procedure for chromatic notation:
1 In most cases where a clear diatonic model is the basis of
the relationship a notation based on the model should be employed.
2 If, however, such a theoretically
correct notation looks
overly complex or unfamiliar, enharmonic equivalents should
be tried.
3 For those relationships
that are generated more and more
from the chromatic genus, the simplest, more playable notation should be employed, and "correctness',' if it appears to be
a debatable point, should be given only secondary consideration.
Tuning
A fully developed chromaticism
can be achieved only in a tunof equal temperament,
wherein
ing based on the principles
twelve pitches and their octaves can express, in reasonable

21
tune, all varieties of pitch names.
Equal temperament has
often been described as the tuning method which makes it possible to play all twenty-four keys equally in tune. From the
chromaticist's
point of view a different emphasis must be
made. It is more pertinent to say that the expanding powers
of chromaticism as represented by the four functions of degree
inflection, and transformation beidentification,
progression,
come fully available for employment in the service
of any
given key only under the conditions of equal temperament.
The history of intonation is an absorbing, and in various respects a controversial
subject.*6
Although many would feel
their spirits sagging as the necessary
mathematical computathe main outlines are

clear and simple enough, for they are concerned with successive attempts to harness for service in music, certain basic
and definitive interval relationships,
namely the perfect fifth

that four successive
conjunct perfect fifths and fourths (for

by the fourth and fifth partials can contain these fifths and
fourths only if the fifths are slightly flat and the fourths
a cycle of twelve pure fifths or
slightly sharp. Furthermore,
their by-products,
three Pythagorean thirds, will create a
sharp octave; but three just thirds will create a flat octave.
The ramifications
are many, but the moral is clear: Just or
pure fifths and thirds will live together harmoniously in an
isolated sound, but they cannot be made to reproduce each
other in a continuous relationship,
nor will they produce a
pure octave.
Equal temperament resolves these and related kinds of pitch

In the process all fifths are

The result is a completely enharmonic

Further, the equal

diminished thirds and diminished fourths and correspondingly
more for major and minor thirds.
Likewise there is in highly
chromatic textures little necessity for distinguishing between
equal pairs such as the diminished fifth (C to Gb) and the augmented fourth (C to F#), unless a diatonic resolution should
intrude.
An arresting case from Tristan and Isolde (Example 22) will
serve to clarify these distinctions
between a predominantly
diatonic and a predominantly chromatic context in shaping interval meanings.

but stands as a
clear indication that the generalized absorbent pitches of equal
temperament are required.
Pity the plight of a Tristan who
is determined to sing his intervals with literal purity. His Ab
of bar 4 will be a fifth tone higher than his G# of bar 2. Equal
temperament must prevail.
The inclusive sense of the passage is clearer than the precise
connotation of each interval, for the whole represents a chromatic extension of the E chord of bars 1 and 5. Ultimately
this chord proves to be a dominant when it progresses,
some
14 bars later, to an A chord. This diatonic ordering factor
acts to clarify the meanings of participating intervals.

One simple demonstration of the clarifying role of immediate
