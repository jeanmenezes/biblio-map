Journal of Music Theory over the Years
Content Analysis of the Articles and Related Aspects

Yosef Goldenberg

Abstract  Bibliometric tools and especially content analysis of all 393 articles published in Journal of Music
Theory (up to issue 48/1) help to investigate the development of the content of this journal. The articles were
classified according to their type, the theoretical aspect, the period of repertoire discussed, and major composers
or theorists they were devoted to. Among the major findings, one can trace in a precise manner the centripetal
process toward focus on Schenkerian and set theories (and the more recent opposite process), the almost total
separation of discussions of tonal and posttonal music, the more recent inclusion of neo-Riemannian theory, the
para-academic nature of some earlier areas of interest, the correlation between an established method and the
repertoire discussed, the general solid focus on hard-core theory with very few glimpses to interdisciplinary studies, and the slow and partial change that involves metatheoretical approaches. Other aspects include the growth
of the journal, its importance, and its editors and contributors.

Introduction

celebrating the jubilee of Journal of Music Theory (henceforth: JMT) offers
a good opportunity for retrospective investigation of the fairly large body of
research in music theory this journal has published over almost fifty years.1
Whereas anniversary issues often include surveys of the “state of the art” with
personal flavor and occasional reminiscences (e.g., Dunsby 2002 in the
­ wentieth-anniversary issue of Music Analysis) or reveal editorial secrets (e.g.,
t
Hatch 2005 in the fortieth-anniversary issue of Current Musicology), my aim here
is to study the entire corpus of articles in JMT using a more systematic method.
While preparing this study, I had no access to informal material concerning the history of JMT, such as inner controversies among members of
the editorial board, unfulfilled ideas, material unaccepted for publication, or
the editing process of accepted articles. Rather, the methods of the present
study are drawn from bibliometrics, a field in the discipline of library science,
which makes a “quantitative analysis of the bibliographic feature of a body of
literature.”2

Bibliographic and Bibliometric Tools for the Examination of JMT

Bibliographic and full-text databases.  JMT is indexed in International Index of
Music Periodicals (IIMP ), RILM Abstracts of Music Literature (since 1967), and
Music Index (since 1975). Only IIMP goes back to 1957, and even it lacks
abstracts and indication of document types for JMT items up to volume 38.3
RILM entries include articles alone (reviews are indexed only under the
reviewed item).4 Music Index aims at a more comprehensive indexing, including references to separate works discussed in a single article. This has been
done sometimes by separate indexing of each reference; in the most extreme
case, a single article (Clarkson 1984) is indexed in Music Index sixteen times.
Since other items are indexed with multiple keywords under a single bibliographic record, and yet other items lack comprehensive indexing, this inconsistent indexing policy prevents any significant results of counting items in
that database. Other problems in the indexes include insufficient indication
of document types and simple indexing errors.5
JSTOR provides searchable full-text access to all issues of JMT until “the
moving wall,” which stood by April 2007 on volume 45/2 (inclusive). The
1,186 JMT items in JSTOR include 489 whose type is indicated as “article” (the
other options being review/editorial/other), but some of them are not really
articles: six of thirteen letters to the editor are indexed as “articles,” as well
as most items from the short forums in the early issues of JMT (see below).
Searches in JSTOR provide some general statistical sense, as one may count
the documents that result for a certain query, but there is no way to count the
appearances of a certain word in a document.

3  In IIMP, the articles are indicated with document type
“research and analysis. Among 773 JMT items, 620 appear
”
when the search asks to “exclude reviews, but these
”
results do include reviews before the document type was
in fact indexed. By April 2007 IIMP is updated only to issue
,
44/1. It does not skip any previous article.
4  Out of 340 JMT entries in RILM, 334 have “document
type” = “Article-in-a-periodical. The exceptional six items
”
include the Neo-Riemannian issue 42/2, which receives an
additional record as “Book:-entire-periodical, and several
”
reviews, whose inclusion in RILM forms an exception in the
indexing policy of that database: one is indicated as “reviewof-facsimile” (Fowler 1978), three as “Review-of-book”
(Godzich 1978, Morris 1982, and Walters 1982 [that actually reviews facsimiles]), and one “Review-of-translation”
(Atkinson 1980). RILM also indexes several exceptional
items that it indicates as articles, such as the conference
report Browne 1995.

5  Music Index includes 833 entries for JMT items, among
which 594 are indicated as articles in their “publication type. There are 236 entries that appear as “printed
”
material review, but 124 reviews are indexed as “publi”
cation type = article. The remaining three items are two
”
o
­ bituaries—Forte et al. 1977 on Oster and Yeston 1980 on
Waite (another obituary, Burkhart 1997 on Krahenbuehl, is
listed as an “article”)—and one item (Strunk 1999) that is
erroneously indicated as “performance. In RILM, errors are
”
less numerous (but the coverage is more partial). Smoliar
1976 has duplicate indexing in RILM.
An important searching tip in both RILM and Music Index
is to exclude items from Dutch Journal of Music Theory
(=Tijdschrift voor Muziektheorie) and Journal of Music Theory Pedagogy. In principle, this should be done by searching
for JMT’s ISSN (0022-2909). However, in RILM this only
gives the 163 records that appear under the journal name
“Journal-of-music-theory, which is used for vols. 11–12 and
”
from vol. 33 forward (search performed on April 7 2007).
,
The 177 records from vols. 13–32 appear without ISSN and
under the journal name “Journal-of-music-theory-USA.

Of course, neither JSTOR nor the bibliographic databases were designed
especially in order to enable statistical examination of journal articles. For
that purpose, queries in existing tools may be useful to a limited extent only.
Citation analysis and content analysis.  Much of the field of bibliometrics
is engaged with statistical analysis of little pieces of data (e.g., citations) where
each single item has little importance. Citation analysis looks attractive for its
apparent ability to measure the academic significance of authors and journals objectively. This method is the basis for the statistical tool Journal Citation
Reports ( JCR ), which exists for science and the social sciences only.6 Another
tool by the Institute of Scientific Information (ISI, currently known as Thomson Scientific), Web of Science (WOS ), searches for citations of existing articles
and also includes Arts and Humanities Citation Index since 1975 (science and
social sciences indices exist since 1965). Thus, JMT articles appear as records
in WOS since 1975, but WOS also indexes citations of earlier items cited since
1975, or items cited in science or social sciences journals since 1965. For each
record it indexes the cited references and its own citations.7
“Cited Ref Search” in WOS offers some very general insights: the most
cited article in JMT is Lerdahl and Jackendoff 1977, cited sixty-two times; only
thirteen articles are cited more than thirty times; twenty-six articles are cited
more than twenty times; and seventy-four articles more than ten times.8 JMT
articles (as defined in this study; see below) are cited 2,309 times in total.9
However, WOS also has severe limitations. The database is incomplete
and does not include pertinent journals such as Theory and Practice and Intégral, and it never searches for citations in books. Also, WOS does not deal well
with journals without a separate reference list. The indexing of cited references in JMT since 1975 until this journal had separate lists of works cited
6  The social sciences edition of JCR includes some music
journals: Computer Music Journal, Journal of Music Therapy, Journal of Research in Music Education, and Music Perception, as well as Acustica, Acta Acustica, and Journal of
the American Acoustical Society. The science edition of JCR
includes Computer Music Journal, the acoustical items, and
Journal of New Music Research. JCR includes various factors and can measure the success of specific authors and
journals, the average number of citations per item, impact
factor, and the age of the median citation
7  WOS found 171 citations of JMT in science journals, 209
in social sciences journals, and 305 together (seventy-five
citations appear in journals that are indexed in both editions). An ordinary search for JMT items in the nonhumanities editions of WOS should provide no results, but a single
JMT article (Polansky and Bassein 1992) is selectively (and
probably by error) indexed in the social sciences edition.
8  Although it is possible to automatically sort the “cited ref
search” results by times cited, the outcome is misleading.
Not only are all citations of pre-1975 articles, which have no

independent records in WOS, absent from such a search, all
inexact citations are absent too (approximately 15 percent
of the entire population of citations). For example, out of
the sixty-two citations of Lerdahl and Jackendoff 1977 only
,
forty-eight appear under the correct record. In that search,
Tenney and Polansky 1980 arrive at first place with fortynine citations (with only three incorrect citations). Inexact
citations include references to incorrect page numbers and
to variants of author names, which are very common when
authors have middle names. WOS itself advises one to look
for variants. Occasionally, errors occur as when Dahlhaus
1975 has a record cited ten times, but since it is indexed
under journal abbreviation “J MUSIC THEORY SPR” instead
of “J MUSIC THEORY,” the Cited Ref Search offers only four
inexact citations of that article.
9  This information is not available from WOS alone. It does
not include citations of reviews. WOS includes 257 records
of articles and 509 records of all types from JMT (since
1975), many of which are never cited in the sources WOS
indexes.

(since 1990, vol. 34) is only selective, and some items misleadingly appear with
“cited references: 0” (e.g., Clough 1979).10
Citation analysis has also general shortcomings. The most cited item
from JMT, after all, is mostly included in the authors’ later book (Lerdahl
and Jackendoff 1983), and thus to a certain extent its importance is diminished. No automatic tool indicates which items were later included in books,
or whether some material in the articles is unique and does not appear in
the later book,11 or (in other cases) in a possibly earlier Ph.D. dissertation.12
More importantly, statistical data analysis cannot differentiate between various
roles of citations and does not give sufficient weight to those citations that are
drawn upon more extensively. Deeper understanding of the development of
a field requires analysis of the content itself, inasmuch as this is possible for
large amounts of articles. Such studies are quite rare, no doubt due to the
larger effort they require and to the lack of automatic assistance.
Content analysis in particular requires professional knowledge in the
analyzed field. It seems to have been applied to music research only in the
field of music education: Yarbrough (1984, 2002) studied research methodologies in Journal of Research in Music Education, and Schmidt and Zdzinski
(1993) analyzed the content of the twenty-six most cited descriptive or experimental articles from six journals in music education. In other bibliometrical studies on music education and therapy, Standley (1984) identified the
most productive authors and institutions as well as the most cited authors in
three music education/therapy journals; Brittin and Standley (1997) studied
scholar eminence in the field; Hamann and Lucas (1998) studied journal eminence in the field via analysis of all citations in six journals during a six-year
period (1990–95); and Gold and Rolvsjord (2006) studied citations of Nordic
Journal of Music Therapy.
In probably the only bibliometric study of noneducation music journals,
Longyear (1977) has studied article citations and “obsolescence” in six music
journals in the period 1973–75 (Acta Musicologica, Journal of the American Musicological Society, Music and Letters, Musica Disciplina, Musical Quarterly, and Music
Review). None of these journals is devoted to theory, although most of them
include occasional theoretical items. Longyear has studied the frequency of
journal article by period, percentages of English and foreign-language citations by journal, intercitations among the six journals, and journal citations by
10  In vols. 10–16, some articles had separate lists of references. Unlike today’s author-date system, these references
were usually based on acronyms of cited titles. See, for
example, Rothgeb 1966.
11  From Lerdahl and Jackendoff 1977 the most prominent
,
material to remain outside the 1983 book is a complete
analysis of Schumann’s “Wehmut” from Liederkreis, op. 39.
The balance in such cases varies from author to author. For
example, Lambert’s 1997 book on Ives incorporates most
of the ideas of Lambert’s 1990 JMT article, but several of

the article examples were not reproduced in the book. Lambert’s other JMT Ives article (1993) does not even appear in
the book’s bibliography.
12  When articles are based on chapters of Ph.D. dissertations, their publication often serves as substitutes for publishing the dissertations in a book format. For a JMT article
based on a doctoral dissertation, see Hook 2002, which
“represents a considerable condensation of chapters 1–6
of the author’s dissertation” (119).

decade or period. The practical conclusion of the last aspect was that it would
be undesirable to weed out these periodicals.
Studies more similar to the present undertaking were applied to the field
of bibliometrics itself, examining the journals JASIS (Journal of the American
Society for Information Science) (Lipetz 1999) and Scientometrics (Schoepflin and
Glanzel 2001). These studies examined only selected issues: one volume from
each decade of JASIS and three sample years of Scientometrics. The limited size
of the samples decreases the reliability of the entire projects: there is a danger
that the sampled issues are not representative; single exceptional items might
have too large an influence on the image of entire fields; the variety of aspects
in the field is not sufficiently present in any single volume; editorial policy
might bring together articles with a common approach even when specific
issues are not intended to be special issues devoted to a single topic; and overly
large gaps of time between the selected issues might prevent thorough explanation of the processes of change over time. Small samples may perhaps be
tolerated for journals in library and information science, where each volume
includes many issues and each issue includes many short items, but not for a
humanities biannual publication with few articles per issue, like JMT.
The Database of the Present Study

This study is based on an independent database of the entire population of
articles in JMT up to issue 48/1 (the last issue to appear by April 2007), produced in Microsoft Access. The completeness of the database is exceptional
in studies of content analysis of all disciplines.
The database includes all 393 articles JMT published until issue 48/1
(inclusive). Other types of documents, such as book reviews, forums, and letters to the editor, are assumed to have a less significant impact than the articles themselves and have been excluded from the studied body of literature.
The price of this decision is leaving some classical items outside the corpus.
For example, Travis 1959 is included in the database, but the reply by Oster
(1960), “a classic in the polemics of music theory” (Rothstein 1986, 12 [1990,
200]), is not.
The source for counting published items as articles was their indication
as articles in the issue’s table of contents, either explicitly (until vol. 19) or by
putting them directly under the heading “contents” (since vol. 20, with two
exceptions).13 This results in a set that is similar but not identical to the corpus of articles found in JSTOR and RILM. Occasionally it is not clear-cut as to
whether a document should count as an “article” or not. In one issue (43/1
[1999]) the table of contents contained no indication of document types.
More importantly, the tables of contents over the years were inconsistent:
13  Issue 41/2 indicated “articles” in the table of contents
since they were preceded by an obituary. Issue 42/1 again
indicated “articles, although nothing preceded them, prob”

ably copying the format of the table of contents from the
previous issue.

30

(1) 	 Four responses to former articles appear among the articles (and
two more “responses” [Rothgeb 1969; Schachter 1969] are actually
part of analysis symposia; see below). Among these, two (Friedmann 1987; Straus 1997a) are very short and do not differ essentially from other responses appearing under the category “forum”
(e.g., Lerdahl and Jackendoff’s 1985 reply to their reviewers Peel
and Slawson [1984], and the reviewers’ reply [Peel and Slawson
1985]) or as letters to the editor (Bernard [1991] responding to
a review [Marvin 1990] of a book of his). On the other hand, one
reply article is indeed a full-length independent article: Beach 1988,
which responds to an article in another journal (Neumeyer 1987).
One more fully independent article (Larson 1997) responds to a
much earlier article (Straus 1987). When Straus (1997a) and Lerdahl (1997) respond to Larson 1997, the result is a kind of “forum”
ten years after the original article appeared.
(2)	 Twice, the hybrid format of a “review article” is listed in the table
of contents as a separate category (Berger 1994, Scotto 2002).
One more “article/review” (Morgan 1999) is described thus in
its title. It appeared in issue 43/1, whose content lacked division
into document types. (These three items are excluded from my
database). Some additional reviews relate to more than one book
(e.g., Clarkson 1968), thus representing essentially the same type
of document; Tischler 1982 was designed as a review of both one
article and one letter to the editor in other journals (Treitler 1979;
Sanders 1980) but was alone in occupying the category of “theory
forum” (compare below).
(3) 	 JMT occasionally included analysis symposia (eight in total, discussed below). The four earlier ones (in vols. 10, 12, 13, and 15)
were listed as a single entry by two or three authors, although in
fact each contributor worked alone. The fifth symposium included
two contributions listed as one entry in volume 18 and an additional contribution in volume 19. This gives three items in total
that appear in the table of contents as two entries. Later symposia
(in vols. 22, 27, and 43) are counted more correctly as separate articles. Together, the eight symposia consist of twenty-three articles
but appear as sixteen entries in the table of contents.
(4) 	 One pedagogy forum was listed among the articles (McGaughey
et al. 1974). This explains the exceptional feature of having eight
authors for one item. Similar items appeared as a “forum,” especially in the journal’s early years.14
14  RILM and IIMP index the pedagogy forum as seven separate entries (the last entry is by two coauthors), and so it
also appears in JSTOR. Music Index does not cover 1974.

Yosef Goldenberg 

  Journal of Music Theor y over the Years

(5) 	 Three articles (excluding the symposia) were divided into two or,
in one case, four parts (in separate, not necessarily consecutive,
issues): Lenneberg 1958a, 1958b; Daniels 1965a, 1965b; Meyers
1964a, 1964b, 1966, 1967. Another article (Fay 1974) is presented
as a “companion” to a former article (Fay 1971). I have counted
each part separately.
Several of these problems could be corrected by adjusting the borders of the
examined corpus, but I found it preferable to adhere to an objective criterion
for inclusion in the studied population (i.e., the table of contents), in order
not to open the Pandora’s box of selecting items for the database. Although
statistical calculations are slightly inflected by the inconsistency in the status of
symposia, their rate in the general population of articles is low and the statistical effect is thus marginal.
Classification of Articles

The database classifies each of the 393 articles in JMT according to several
parameters. These include the following, in addition to practical indications
such as volume and issue location, author identification, and number of
pages:
(1) Type of article.  Only 351 out of the 393 items that are listed among
the articles in JMT’s tables of contents are actually articles in the accepted
sense. I have called these “essays,” a subclass of the general category “article.” Articles that are not essays include bibliographies, translations, reports,
responses, and analysis symposia.
(2) The theoretical aspect.  This field in the database combines the theoretical approach (e.g., metatheory, history of theory) with the subject matter
(e.g., contour theory, set theory). Although the phenomenological status of
the entries in this field is somewhat heterogeneous, the various aspects are
too interdependent to enable splitting the field. For example, Schenkerian
theory can be viewed as both a branch of music theory and a system of looking
at harmony and voice leading. I permitted every article to possess up to three
aspects (519 aspect/subject records for 393 articles). This procedure has the
disadvantage of creating more statistical weight for multivalent articles but is
necessary in order to describe faithfully articles with multiple methods, especially articles with historical or philosophical aspects. For example, Dubiel
1990 is described as both “metatheory” and “Schenker,” and no single aspect
could cover it sufficiently. In principle, statistical calculations could be based
on equal weight for every article, where the score of an article with more than
one subject would be divided among its subjects. Nonetheless, the results of
this procedure might be misleading. For example, Dubiel’s article might have
received a 50 percent score as metatheory and a 50 percent score as Schenkerian theory, but in fact, both aspects of this item relate to the entire article.

31

32

J our n a l o f M usi c T h e ory

I have devised near but distinct codes for related approaches in order
to enable queries relating to both the wider and narrower approaches. For
example, (unordered) set theory had the code 80, and theory of ordered
twelve-tone music was designated as 82. This enables searches for the range
“>79 and <83” when required.
(3) The period of repertoire discussed.  I have followed the accepted periodization of Western art music, so that the periods are not of equal size. A
separate code for discussions of tonal music in general enabled having a maximum of two periods per article. Special period codes indicate non-Western
music repertoires. For many theoretical abstract articles, this field was irrelevant.
(4) Composers.  I have indexed the discussed composers in articles that
discuss a single composer, or mainly a single composer. Such articles often
analyze specific pieces. With articles dealing with two composers, I have indicated the composers only when they are very salient (e.g., when both are indicated in the title, as in Suurpää 2000).
(5) Theorists.  For some articles, especially those devoted to the history
of theory (including translations), the true subject of the article is not a specific composer, but rather a specific theorist. For composer-theorists, such as
Schoenberg, it is useful to distinguish articles concerning their theory (e.g.,
Boss 1994) from others that concern their music (e.g., Hyde 1980). This number does not contain all existing articles relating to Schenker. Since Schenker’s
theory became so paradigmatic for the analysis of tonal music, I preferred to
identify “Schenker” as a discussed theorist only for articles devoted specifically
to Schenker’s theory or writings. However, the borders between theoretical
discussion and analytical application of Schenkerian theory are ambiguous
(e.g., Burkhart 1978).

For a more general view of JMT, I also counted documents other than articles
(e.g., reviews) per issue and took special note of rare types of documents, but
I did not examine the content of those other documents.
The data I have gathered has been subjected to mathematical operations enabled by the Microsoft Access application: articles selected according
to various parameters could be counted effectively and averages of various
results (and their standard deviations) could be found. For the purpose of
tracing changes over the years, I divided the 47.5 volumes of JMT included
in the study into five decades (the last one incomplete). In certain contexts,
however, I recognized less arbitrary points of change.
Journal of Music Theory and Journals of Music Theory

As is well known, JMT was a pioneer in the specialist study of music theory.
It was the first journal in English to be specifically devoted to music theory.
(In German, there were the short-lived, Schenkerian forerunners Der Tonwille

[1921–24] and Der Dreiklang [1937–38].) The institution of JMT was a milestone in the establishment of music theory as an independent discipline.15
Since 1957, JMT appeared with remarkable steadiness twice a year, albeit with
some delays, notably in the last decade (vol. 47 bears the date of 2003, but as
the copyright indication reveals, it actually appeared in 2006). Each volume
consists of two issues, except for four volumes (vols. 15, 16, 35, and 46) that
included only one double issue.
Despite the steady number of issues, JMT grew considerably and fairly
constantly over the years, at least until very recently. This is evident in the
number of pages per issue.16 The first volume is the shortest of all (235 pages;
the single shortest issue, however, was 14/2, with 106 pages), and the longest
volume is among the latest (vol. 44, which has 502 pages, with each issue
having more pages than did the entire first volume). The largest issue is vol.
46/1–2 (375 pages), which is both recent and consists of a double issue. The
other double issues are only slightly larger than the largest single issues (266
to 298 pages). The first issue to pass 200 pages was 10/2. Table 1 presents the
average number of pages per volume, divided into five decades. The two last
issues, 47/2 and 48/1, published after a long break in actual publication of
JMT, are considerably thinner than the norm in recent volumes, with 144 and
146 pages, respectively. Only eighteen past issues of JMT were thinner, most
of them in the early years and none later than 34/1. The growth in the page
count of JMT volumes began slowly, but then accelerated. Even though the
growth is not entirely consistent—for example, vols. 39–43 (1995–99) were

15  For information and evaluation concerning the foundation of JMT, see the editorial introduction to the first issue
(Krahenbuehl 1957), quoted and discussed in his obituary
(Burkhart 1997) and reproduced in this issue. See also Forte
1998, 11.
16  The numbering I calculate here is derived from the table
of contents: the page number of the last item (usually the
index or contributors list, which occupies a single page)
minus the number of the first page in the issue. When the
last item in the issue is longer, I have actually looked at the

last page. This number does not include pages of advertisements. Until vol. 19 (inclusive), articles usually began on
even pages and their titles occupied more than half of the
first two pages. This means that these articles were in fact
shorter than later articles that occupy the same number of
pages. Whenever an article ends on an odd page (since vol.
20) or on an even page (until vol. 19), a blank page is inserted
between them, formerly filled in with tailpieces. My calculations based on the table of contents add this page to the
preceding article.

smaller than the preceding volumes and included only 1,820 pages (averaging
364 pages per volume)—the trend is absolutely clear.
The growth of JMT is only the tip of the iceberg in the growth of the
literature on music theory. Most of the growth in the field was realized by
the rapid emergence of additional periodicals. A clear “periodical boom”
occurred in the late 1970s and early 1980s, whereas in the last two decades
new periodicals are few and usually less significant. Most significant are Music
Theory Spectrum (founded 1979, vols. 1–10 annual, since 1989 biannual) and
the British Music Analysis (since 1982, triannual), but notice also In Theory Only
(1975–92), Theory and Practice (1976), Indiana Theory Review (1977), and Intégral (1986), as well as the German Musiktheorie (1986) and the French Analyse
Musicale (1975–95). By contrast, the 1990s added only the electronic Music
Theory Online (1993), and even encountered a certain decline (with the non­
official close of In Theory Only). Although some of these journals only indirectly overlap with JMT, and despite the existence of other publishing venues
in the field in earlier years—most notably the book series The Music Forum
(1967–80), which ceased publication precisely with the great boom—the existence of an impressive and rather sudden “periodical boom” is indisputable.
The boom is even more extreme than the given list of periodicals suggests
since additional periodicals where analytical and theoretical articles are occasionally published started to appear in the same period (Nineteenth-Century
Music since 1977, triannual; Journal of Musicology since 1982, quarterly).
A partial explanation for this sudden growth is the establishment of the
Society for Music Theory (1977).17 On the direct level, the society publishes
Music Theory Spectrum (and Music Theory Online); on a more general level, the
establishment of the society both reflected the desire for specialization in
music theory and promoted it. A more complete explanation might have to
consider general trends in the humanities, as well as financial issues.
A different kind of periodical specializes in more specific aspects of
music theory. Two journals of this kind were initiated in 1987: Theoria: Historical Aspects of Music Theory and Journal of Music Theory Pedagogy. Since both historical investigation and pedagogy may be applied to any branch of music theory, these journals might attract a wide range of scholars. Two newly founded
journals, Journal of Schenkerian Studies (vol. 1, 2005) and Journal of Music and
Mathematics (vol. 1/1, 2007), might signify a new phase of more specialized
periodicals in subfields of music theory. Recently, it has also been possible to
trace an opposite approach of despecialization, as the conferences of the Society for Music Theory have been combined with those of the American Musico-

17  The establishment of the Society for Music Theory was
preceded by two “National Conferences on Music Theory”
in 1975 and 1976 and a plenary session in the 1976 joint
meeting of the American Musicological Society and College
Music Symposium. See Schachter 1977 and Browne 1979.

logical Society in joint meetings every other year since the mega-conference
“Musical Intersections” (Toronto, 2000), which combined fifteen additional
societies.
It is possible to measure the status of JMT in relation to other music journals in Web of Science (WOS ) Arts and Humanities Index (A&HI ). The coverage
of WOS includes five journals devoted to music theory: JMT, Music Theory Spectrum, Music Analysis, In Theory Only, and Musiktheorie.18 I have searched for citations (in all editions of WOS, including science and the social sciences) of the
three covered music theory journals in English with continued publication.19
Table 2 shows the results. Data concerning the entire amount of citations have
been divided in the number of items of all document types and in the number
of articles as found in WOS. The search has been limited for items since 1984,
when WOS started indexing Music Theory Spectrum.20 The items of JMT are
found to be (on average) the most cited of the three journals. According to
this criterion, JMT preserves its status as the leading journal in its field.
Editors and Contributors

Up to issue 48/1, JMT had seen fifteen editors. Two editors edited fourteen
issues each: Allen Forte edited vols. 4/2 to 11/1, and Martha McLean Hyde
edited vols. 25–31. The other editors edited up to eight issues.21 The most
influential editor is no doubt the second one, Allen Forte, whose scholarship
18  It is impossible to browse the WOS sources by topic.
Searching in the titles list of WOS, one finds sixty-eight periodicals whose titles include “music, twelve with “musik,
”
”
and two with “musique. Additional covered music journals
”
do not have these words in their titles, for example, Clavier,
Strings, Journal of Jazz Studies, and In Theory Only. The
sources list also includes journals in the science and social
sciences editions of WOS. Some journals whose titles
include “music” are not in the A&HI, for example, Biological Foundations of Music.
19  Dunsby (2002, 7) acknowledges the similarity—and a
difference—between these three journals as he writes in
Music Analysis of “the estimable pages of our nevertheless
so politically correct sister (or should that be ‘sibling’?) publications Music Theory Spectrum and JMT.”

20  It is best to count articles in WOS itself, in order to have
it compatible with the citation counts. I preferred not to use

“had largely defined the scope and direction of the field of music theory over
the past decades” (Baker, Beach, and Bernard 1997, 7).
The 393 articles were written by 304 different contributors; 351 are by a
22
single author, thirty-seven are by thirty-four different teams­ of two coauthors
(including three symposia, where each author worked alone), four articles are
by three coauthors (including two symposia), and one is the pedagogy forum
(McGaughey et al. 1974) by eight authors, which actually consisted of seven
independent contributions, the last of which was coauthored by two writers.
Of the 304 authors, few used JMT extensively: Leading are David Beach (thirteen articles), David Lewin (twelve), Allen Forte (ten), John Clough (eight),
Robert Morris (six), and John Rothgeb (five). Seven authors had four JMT
articles, nine had three articles, fifty-four (17.8 percent) had two articles, and
229 (75.3 percent) had a single article in JMT.23
The most famous figures among JMT contributors seem to be the composers––George Rochberg, Milton Babbitt, Donald Martino, Thomas DeLio,
and Broadway composer Maury Yeston. Some other authors are also known
principally as composers (e.g., Margaret Vardell Sandresky), and some major
theorist-authors (notably David Lewin) are also composers. No composer has
written in JMT on his own music, but Martino appears also as a subject of
another article (Rothstein 1980).
Female authors are a small minority among the authors of JMT articles:
thirty-eight out of 304 article contributors (12.5 percent) participated in fortyone of 393 articles (10.4 percent).24 Thirty-four of these are represented by a
single article in JMT, and none have more than two articles. Among the 351
articles by a single author, only thirty-two (9.1 percent) are by female authors.
In two cases, married couples contributed articles together: Brender and
Brender (1967) and Becker and Becker (1979); in one case, both coauthors
are female (Etzion and Weich-Shahak 1993).
Document Types in Journal of Music Theory and Related Topics

Readers well acquainted with the ordinary balance between items in JMT in
the last decades may be struck by the different balance in the early volumes
of JMT. The changes in this balance might well reflect changes in editorial
policy, but I shall refrain from attempting to ascribe specific decisions to specific editors.
22  The recurring coauthor teams are Boomsliter and Creel,
Lerdahl and Jackendoff, and Knopoff and Hutchinson.
Clough and Douthett coauthored one article alone (Clough
and Douthett 1991) and one article together with a third
coauthor (Clough, Cuciurean, and Douthett 1997).

Lejaren Hiller is not the father of Lejaren A. Hiller Jr. but the

composers whose music is brought in in examples and at
least in one case the translator (of Winckel 1963).

Each issue of JMT includes articles and virtually always reviews, in varying proportions. No consistent trend is found in the percentage of the whole
volume occupied by articles (see Table 3). However, a modest increase can be
detected in both the number of articles per volume and the average length of
the articles. These two factors together contribute to the growth in the page
count of JMT. The articles in JMT do not have abstracts: these were added
twice, in issues 34/1 and 43/2, but discontinued in the following issues until
the present one.
In order to facilitate comparison with the double issues, it is better to
count articles per volume, rather than per issue. The number of articles per
volume lies between four (vol. 16) and twelve (vol. 10), with one exception
(sixteen articles in vol. 42) that results from the special character of issue
42/2 (see below). The average is 8.19 articles per volume, and the standard
deviation is 2.04; without the exceptional volume, the average is 8.02 and the
standard deviation is only 1.70.
The number of reviews per volume differs more greatly, from none at all
in five issues (5/2, 36/1, the special 42/2, and two of the three latest issues,
47/1 and 48/1) to no fewer than twelve reviews (1/2; 1/1 has eleven and the
maximum after vol. 1 is ten reviews in 11/1). The general curve of the number
of reviews is complementary to that of the number of articles: it begins high,
descends, ascends, and descends again. The appearance of so many reviews
in the thin early volumes points to their relative shortness. The fall and new
rise in the evaluation of reviews is evident not in their amount alone but also
in their place in the table of contents: In the first three volumes, under the
editorship of David Krahenbuehl, reviews were listed in the table of contents,
as is done today. However, in vol. 4 they were removed, as is perhaps appropriate with library-oriented, multiple short descriptions as in Notes, but less
so in a scholarly journal. The recovery of respect for reviews began with the
inclusion of reviewers’ names (without reviewed titles) in the table of con-

38

J our n a l o f M usi c T h e ory

tents (since issue 21/1) and was only completed in issue 28/1. However, the
fall and new rise do not correspond exactly to the number of reviews: during the seventeen volumes where reviews were not indicated in the table of
contents, there appeared 118 reviews (6.94 average reviews/volume), that is,
more reviews/volume than in the second and the (incomplete) fifth decades
of JMT, although in the latter the tables of contents do indicate reviews.
The precise count of reviews is, like that of articles, slightly problematic.
Occasionally, one review addresses several books together (e.g., the aforementioned Clarkson 1968), and in a single case, a review symposium (Schachter
1981, Epstein 1981, Benjamin 1981) is dedicated to a single book—Free Composition (Schenker [1935] 1979). This special honor, given to a translation
of an older book, no doubt reflects the book’s special status in music theory.
Volume 45 included a “Schenker Symposium” of reviews: issue 1 included no
fewer than six reviews, and issue 2 included three more reviews. The table of
contents of issue 2 declared these three reviews to be part 2 of 3, but that is
all that has been published. Some recent issues of JMT were published with a
serious delay and with few or no reviews at all.
Table 3 sums up the numbers of articles and reviews per volume in each
of the five decades and calculates the average number of pages per article and
the percentage the articles occupy in a volume.
The first six volumes of JMT also included a category called “forum” that
consisted of shorter contributions and replies. Two issues (3/1 and 4/1) even
included both a forum on practical issues and a “theory forum.” This kind of
forum has no equivalent in today’s JMT or in other American music periodicals, but it follows closely the German tradition of Kleine Beiträge, which can
still be encountered, for example, in Die Musikforschung. The forum’s task of
shared thought is fulfilled today to a certain extent by the discussion list of the
Society for Music Theory, but its omission predated the electronic revolution
by many years.
Later volumes of JMT only very occasionally included forums. Examining the forums reveals a situation familiar from musical terminology (e.g.,
with “sonata”): one title indicates various kinds of items, while similar phenomena appear under various names. Series of responses appeared as a forum
three more times after vol. 6 (26/2 continued in 27/2, 29/1, and 36/1), but
other times they appeared without that title (e.g., the aforementioned Larson
1997, Straus 1997a, and Lerdahl 1997); vol. 16/1–2 includes a “symposium”
on music theory in the seventeenth century (Cohen et al. 1972), which resembled such constructs as the early “forum” on pedagogical issues (Krahenbuehl
et al. 1959); issue 33/1 offered a very extraordinary metatheoretical “theory
colloquium,” which consisted of a full-length article (Brown and Dempster
1989) with a series of four responses. This special event was even announced
on the cover. An editorial introduction to the colloquium (Hasty, van den
Toorn, and Marshall 1989) promised to “enliven the pages of this journal”
with further projects of this kind, but such projects never did take place.

The omission of forums from the usual later issues seems to reflect a
desire to concentrate, within a scholarly journal, on larger studies that pre­
sent more than a preliminary idea. The later forums actually create partly special issues. Other partly special issues include the eight analysis symposia (see
below) and a series of four articles on electronic music that appeared in 7/1
and continued in the three following issues with five more articles, whereas no
single article on electronic music appeared after vol. 11.25 Issue 42/2 (1998) is
a relatively recent exception. This is a special issue that is not only devoted to
one subject (neo-Riemannian theory), but actually results from a single conference and has features of a “conference proceedings” volume, such as prefacing acknowledgments that resemble a short editorial introduction (Clough
2002) and a unified bibliography for all articles. The work on the articles
was even prepared in collaboration, as is evident from the mutual references.
These exceptional procedures explain why this issue includes twelve articles
and no reviews at all.26
Instances of other content types appear in JMT only occasionally: thirty
issues include one or more letters to the editor. These are spread over the
years (vols. 1–47), with several gaps, the largest of which embraces nine years
(from vol. 8 to vol. 17), but despite this gap the average volume number with
letters to the editor is slightly early (22.4). Less frequently appear conference
reviews (six times, between 31/1 and 39/2), corrigenda (four times, between
30/1 and 36/2), editorials (in the three first issues, and on three more occasions), and obituaries (twice only).27 The first obituary (Forte et al. 1977) was
dedicated to Ernst Oster, the famous Schenkerian student of Oswald Jonas
and translator of Free Composition (Schenker [1935] 1979). This obituary was a
series of no fewer than ten contributions, most of which had a personal flavor
(Schachter was the only contributor to include a truly analytical point in his
contribution). The second obituary (Burkhart 1997) was dedicated to JMT’s
first editor, David Krahenbuehl, and was on the border between memories
and historiography of the modern field. One might have expected additional
obituaries, for example, on the occasion of Felix Salzer’s death in 1986. Hindemith, an important figure not only as a composer but as a theorist as well,
received no obituary on his death in 1963, but later two articles were devoted
to his role in music theory (Thomson 1965, Forte 1998), of which the later
one in particular resembles in nature the obituary for Krahenbuehl.
More marginal items include announcements of future events in twentyfour issues, the earliest in 21/1 (average volume 29.5), and advertisements for
books and journals in fifty-six issues, the earliest in 15/1–2 (average volume
25  The series of articles on electronic music had already
been announced before its inception, in JMT 6/2.
26  Interestingly, Music Theory Spectrum had in 2002 a special issue for the first time (issue 24/2). However, that special issue did not result from a conference, and the editorial
introduction (Harrison 2002) almost apologized for betraying

the journal’s usual diversity (as the “spectrum” in its title
indicates) and promised it would not be a constant feature
of that journal.
27  Another short obituary message, Yeston 1980 on William G. Waite, had been included in the front matter.

J our n a l o f M usi c T h e ory

30.5).28 Until 40/2, every issue included a list of recent books and articles
(with two exceptions: 21/2 and 29/2). For one issue, the list of books was
referred to with the more general name “publications received,” and then
(vols. 37–40) it continued to appear for four more years as a “list of books
received.” All issues of JMT include the list of contributors, and every last
issue per volume includes an index of the entire volume. The earliest indexes
appeared bound separately and perhaps slightly delayed (the index of vol.
3–4 was made together, and, as far as I could verify, it was published with issue
5/1).
Before we turn to the content of the articles, I have some remarks concerning the external format of JMT.29 The covers of the first issues appeared in
a solid style, occasionally with drawings. Subsequently, there followed a period
of four years (vols. 5–8) during which JMT looked considerably more experimental, using color covers with very unequal sizing of title letters. Such covers
seem to express a certain zeitgeist, especially when appearing in such a rigorous journal such as JMT. Elements of nonpractical design were preserved until
vol. 19 (inclusive), as the tables of contents were spaced on two pages, as were
also the article titles, which appeared midpage. Starting in 1995 (vol. 39), JMT
used a logo that was slightly more attractive to the eye than the ordinary covers it had most of its years. On several occasions, JMT had special covers, most
notably in issue 25/1, which celebrated the twenty-fifth anniversary of JMT.
Content Analysis of the Articles
JMT’s Leading Subjects: Schenkerian Theory and Set Theory

I ascribed 465 subjects to the 351 items I called “essays” (487 subjects to 365
items including analysis symposia, 519 subjects to all 393 articles). The results
are presented in Table 4.
The most common methods discussed in JMT are clearly Schenkerian theory and set theory. According to the narrow definitions of these
subjects, they comprise seventy-three articles (fifty-four essays) and sixty-five
articles (sixty-four essays), respectively. With related subjects (detailed description below), they comprise eighty-eight and eighty-five articles, respectively.
Although overlaps between Schenkerian theory and set theory are possible
(since I have enabled more than one subject per article), in fact only one
essay (Parks 1985) combines both methods directly, so that the total of 137
references represents no fewer than 136 articles (34.9 percent of the total 393

28  I have not counted the amount of advertisements, but I
have noticed a gradual increase until 39/2; after 40/1, which
had none at all, there is a certain decrease.

29  Two issues bear wrong identifications: the cover of 5/1
indicates issue 5/2 (the covers for issues 5/1 and 5/2 are
absent in JSTOR, an exception probably due to that confusion), and the table of contents of 28/1 erroneously indicates 27/2.

Yosef Goldenberg

articles).30 In the complete population of articles, Schenkerian theory passes
set theory since it was involved in most symposia.
The counting is based upon my independent indexing. Browsing Schenkerian bibliographies reveals slightly different results: Berry 2004 includes
eighty-three JMT articles (updated to 45/2), excluding the Schenkerian bibliographies. Six items are missing (e.g., McNamee 1985 and Forte 1988), but
many marginal items are included, due to Berry’s wise policy “to err on the
side of inclusion” (Berry 2004, 1). Ayotte 2004 is considerably less complete
and includes fifty-eight JMT entries (excluding the bibliographies) but also at
least one irrelevant item—Forte 1992 on Hindemith.31 A JSTOR search provides 133 JMT articles with “Schenker” until 45/2, but these do include letters
to the editor and some communications.
Examining the growth and/or decline of Schenkerian theory is especially interesting since contradicting impressions were expressed in relation
to it in about the same period: Kerman, who is skeptical toward Schenkerism, claimed that “Schenker’s prestige and influence are sinking, though not
without dignity, in the United States” (although they are emerging in Britain)
(1985, 88), whereas the devoted Schenkerist Rothstein (1986, 5 [1990, 193])
claimed to the contrary that “the Schenkerian empire is still in its expanding
phase.”32 As in politics, every party claims it is going to win (and perhaps truly
feels it is going to win). Equipped with bibliometric tools, I am prepared to
bring more objective findings. At least as far as JMT is concerned, Rothstein
was much more aware than Kerman of the recent literature in the field of
music theory. In the 1980s, Schenkerian theory in the United States was only
beginning its real flourishing. The particular point of change can be traced
to the English translation of Free Composition (Schenker [1935] 1979), which
received, as we have seen, a special review symposium.
Schenkerian theory was introduced into JMT in an early and general
article (Forte 1959).33 Due to its nature, that article can still be read today
by less professional readers than would be required for most articles in the
field; on the other hand, it is perhaps unnecessary to get acquainted with
Schenkerian theory via such an article today, when Schenker’s main books
are translated into English and especially when good textbooks exist. The
appearance of such an introductory discussion in JMT is exceptional and is
reserved for presentations of young fields, most notably Cohn 1998 on neoRiemannian theory.
30  Forte 1992 and Nolan 1995 also include aspects related
to Schenkerian theory and set theory and thus are counted
twice among the larger groups of eighty-eight and eighty-six
items. McNamee 1985 does not appear in that calculation
due to its more eclectic character, but it, too, combines both
methods as when it claims (68) for “middleground occurrences of set 4–26. Rothgeb 1966, mainly related to set
”
theory, also mentions Schenker, but mainly suggests the
premature state of the art then.

31  Ayotte (2004, 74) explains that “Forte also discusses the
influences of Schenker and Babbitt, which served to effectively undermine the influence of Hindemith’s ideas.
”
32  Rothstein in his consistent observations has added
recently, “Schenker vit” (Rothstein 2001, 224).
33  Berry (2004, 60) lists in his Schenkerian bibliography an
even earlier JMT item (Reynolds 1958), where “the author’s
commentary borders on Schenkerian at times.

Subfield of Schenkerian Theory

A close-up content analysis of the Schenkerian articles reveals some
changes in the subfield. Two complementary shifts in emphasis can be seen in
relatively recent volumes of JMT. These can be inferred from Table 5, which
shows subfields of Schenkerian theory and corollary studies on hierarchy, with
the number of articles and the average volume The table is organized according to the latter factor. One direction dwells on the detailed ramifications of
the theory, exploring specific configurations on the ground of the well-studied
terrain. Some configurations are problematic for the method as a whole (e.g.,
Smyth 1999; Everett 2004), but others are not necessarily so (Beach 1983).
The other direction is para-Schenkerian studies, most notably metatheoretical
studies (e.g., Zbikowsky 1997), which reflect the influence of the “new musicology” that appeared in JMT since the appearance of the “theory colloquium”
in 1989 (more on this trait below). Evidence as to the metatheoretical change
influencing Schenkerian theory can be found in comparing the definition of
“prolongation” in the first edition of New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians (Drabkin 1980) with the same author’s revision in the second edition
(Drabkin 2000). The revision replaced “the generation of the substance of
a tonal piece” with “the generation of the harmonic and contrapuntal substance,” accepting additional, perhaps less purely musical, aspects of a piece’s
“substance.”34 There is a certain contradiction between the two directions, but
both seem emblematic for an advanced state of knowledge.
Set theory was similarly introduced to JMT with an early general article
(Babbitt 1961), and with even earlier related items concerning serial music
(Rochberg 1959). It, too, flourished mainly in the later decades of JMT, with
a certain decline in quantity more recently. The specialization in set theory is
even clearer than in Schenkerian studies, while metatheoretical discussions of
it remain outside JMT (but exist elsewhere, as in Davis 1995 and John Rahn
2001).
34  Rothstein (2001) observes many more changes in a similar spirit between the editions of the New Grove. The detail
I mention here is not cited by Rothstein.

Set theory is of course based on mathematical foundations, albeit mostly
on combinatorics and not directly on mathematical, axiomatic, set theory. A
succinct letter to the editor (Kaarela 1992) even complains: “I am wondering
why you are persistently turning the journal into a Journal of Mathematics
which, really, is of little long term significance, rather than returning to real
music.” Several contributors, most notably the late David Lewin, possess mathematical expertise.35 Many articles (e.g., Agmon 1996) require mathematical
knowledge not only from the author but from the reader as well. It is only very
recently that JMT included an essay (Satyendra 2004) that offers less mathematically oriented music theorists an “informal introduction” to the work of
David Lewin without mathematical formulations.
One might answer the quoted complaint that high music theory, especially of posttonal music, indeed involves mathematical elements. Moreover,
even elementary theory is often objected to by undergraduates as being “too
technical” without “getting at the heart” (Poirel 1998, 72). Just as we see
roman numerals and hear the harmonic degrees behind them, we should
learn to hear the pitch-class set-classes behind Forte numbers (albeit these
are wanting in intuitiveness, as Maegaard 1985 argues convincingly). Even
analyses of specific works (e.g., the ear-opening Forte 1988) might be drawn in
mathematical presentation. Indeed, nonmathematical observations in older
contributions (e.g., Fuller 1975 on features of the diatonic scale) might seem
today as ineffective presentations of private cases of set relations. It is indeed
noteworthy that JMT includes seven articles (the earliest Demske 1988, the
latest Buchler 2001) that concentrate on the mathematical aspects and do not
refer explicitly to the musical application. One reason that such articles were
submitted to JMT rather than to journals of mathematics may be that they are
based on naive rather than axiomatic set theory and study particular problems
of interest largely to musical set theorists.36
Other Current Theoretical Subjects in JMT

Both Schenkerian theory and set theory are well-defined methods, and despite
a certain variability in their application, they are more than general subjects of
interest. Other subdisciplines that are similarly “tight” arose relatively recently:
contour theory (three essays and one reply) and especially transformational
35  Although mathematical articles need not be short, the
extreme brevity of Lewin 1976 (four pages) no doubt results
from his use of mathematical formulas. (By the way, this
article is missing in RILM.) As Lewin himself says elsewhere (Lewin 1987 89) of another contribution by himself
,
(Lewin 1959), “Its style, unfortunately, makes few concessions to a non-mathematical reader.
”
36  Citations of JMT in articles that do not concern music are
extremely rare. Most of the 171 citations of JMT in sources
that appear in the Science Index Expanded edition of WOS

refer either to items from journals with relevance to music
(75 items) or at least music-oriented articles in nonmusic
journals (83 items, e.g., Silverman and Wiseman 2006).
The thirteen exceptions include at least three errors. See,
however, the discussion of maximally even sets in Journal
of Mathematical Physics (Krantz, Douthett, and Doty 1998)
and a citation of DeLio 1980 in Fibbonacci Quarterly (Wilcox
1986).

(neo-Riemannian) theory (twenty-four articles, sixteen of which are in the
latest period, including twelve in the special issue 42/2). (Notably, traditional
Riemannian theory is absolutely absent from JMT.)37 Such tight theoretical
alternatives differ from the scattered experimentations that appeared in JMT
in the 1960s along with Schenkerian analyses, in the analytical symposia (e.g.,
Palmer’s contribution within Beach, Mintz, and Palmer 1969, 207–17).
In contrast to the tight methods, wider topics such as harmony, rhythm,
counterpoint, and form must be considered looser aspects that indicate the
studied musical parameters while leaving space for a larger variety of methods.
Such general subjects form the main undergraduate curriculum. Their relatively limited space in current advanced theory as represented in JMT reflects
an arguably growing distance between practical theory and analysis, and the
high theory (see below). The latest issues of JMT (vol. 47 and issue 48/1)
show a remarkable shift that is more tolerant to the general theory studies.
For example, Harrison 2003 studies sequential patterns based on harmony
and counterpoint in their straightforward sense. Even Pearsall 2004, using set
theory, studies surface motives in a way much removed from the most abstract
set-theoretical studies.
Earlier Areas of Interest

Readers familiar with JMT since about the late 1970s might wonder what
had been included in this journal before Schenkerian theory and set theory
became its standard methods. After all, in the earliest decade only fourteen of
eighty articles (17.5 percent) were engaged with these theories.
Indeed, several topics and methods that were prominent in JMT’s early
periods were totally abandoned later. One such specific methodology is the
application of information (or communication) theory to music (eleven items,
six of which are in the earliest decade). The reappearance of articles on that
method in 1981 and 1983 (Knopoff and Hutchinson 1981, 1983) might look
puzzling, but eventually the authors conclude that information theory has
little value for the study of music.
Other early articles addressed issues that are not truly musical. All JMT
articles on electronic music were engaged with technical aspects and might
have had practical interest more for composers than for theorists. This is true
also for items that discuss technical aspects of sound production of nonelectronic music (e.g., Truax 1976). True analytical investigation of electronic
music is possible (as in Simoni 2005) but has never been performed in JMT.
37  In a study of non-transformational aspects of Riemann’s
theories, Waldbauer (1989, 333) still claims “the neglect
of Riemann continues, but Ian Bent’s comment quoted
”
there that “it is in his theory of phrase structure . . . that
Riemann has most to offer” remains an offshoot. Riemann’s
theory is discussed in JMT in historical and metatheoretical perspectives (e.g., in Hyer 1995), and some translations

of Riemann’s work appear (Wason and Marvin 1992; the
nontransformational Mooney 2000), but Riemannian harmonic symbols are not used in JMT even once. By contrast,
German periodicals such as Musiktheorie continue to use
Riemannian Funktiontheorie as the standard tool for analyzing tonal and even extended tonal music. See, for example,
Brauneiss 1996 on Britten.

Yosef Goldenberg

Another topic that is not academic in essence is the survey of music
software. Thirteen articles, all of them in vols. 9–20 except for one much later
item (Brinkman 1986), deal with aspects of encoding and representation of
musical notes on computer. Only some of them discuss (in various degrees)
software that is specific for analytical or theoretical purposes (e.g., Erickson
1968), but even these must only count as descriptions of tools that might assist
analysts. None of them showed an original analytical output.38
Similarly, articles on acoustics or tuning appeared mostly in the early
periods (fifteen articles in the earliest decade, ten in all later periods, and
nothing after Carey and Clampitt 1996).
A very different direction that was present only in JMT’s early periods is
pedagogy. Almost every music theorist teaches theory, but pedagogical problems seldom illuminate truly theoretical or analytical points. JMT included
four articles on pedagogy, one of them actually a pedagogy forum (along
with two “pedagogy forums” described as such), and among these only one
(the latest of them, Maegaard 1985, on set theory) discussed aspects of the
theoretical apparatus itself. The establishment of a separate journal, Journal
of Music Theory Pedagogy, provided a separate platform for the discussion of
pedagogical issues.
Remote Disciplines

Beyond the mathematical foundations of set theory (and acoustics), music
theory as reflected in JMT is a very inward-looking (or “inside-looking”) discipline.39 Nontheoretical aspects of musicology rarely penetrate the articles,
although the scope of the reviews is apparently wider and occasionally even
includes reviews of books that are intended for the wider public (e.g., Whittenberg 1969). A few isolated articles discuss aspects such as sketches and performance. Historical aspects of music enter JMT almost exclusively through a
strict theoretical perspective, and biographical discussions are virtually absent
in JMT.
Nonmusical disciplines are invoked in JMT even more rarely. Their
selection might be surprising if one expects to find disciplines traditionally
thought of as related to music: nothing at all on visual arts; a single and recent
article on narrativity (Almén 2003); a single semiotic review/essay (Berger
1994 review of Agawu 1991);40 a single article on movement, but not in its

38  The concentration on technical issues and software in a
certain period of JMT is evident in the low standard deviation of volume number for these subjects (3.65 for the former, 5.75 for the latter, 3.64 for the latter without the latest
item), exceptional among subjects with more than a handful
of articles.

39  An inward-looking discipline is a discipline where the
cited sources come mainly from within the discipline itself.
This feature has been studied, for example, by Peritz and
Bar-Ilan 2001.
40  As the bibliography of Almén 2003 suggests, other
journals in music theory included narrativity articles much
earlier.

48

J our n a l o f M usi c T h e ory

artistic manifestations (Saslaw 1996); and three articles that relate music to
linguistics. The topic of linguistics was an important subject in music theory
in the 1980s, mostly due to A Generative Theory of Tonal Music (Lerdahl and
Jackendoff 1983), but the linguistic aspect is not discussed in the authors’
related article in JMT (Lerdahl and Jackendoff 1981), the review of the book
(Peel and Slawson 1984), and the debate following the review (Lerdahl and
Jackendoff 1985; Peel and Slawson 1985).
The preference of “tight” disciplines seems to reflect philosophical positivism (Davis 1995, on atonal theory). Maus (1993, 265) even claims, and
perhaps overstates, that “omissions that characterize much contemporary theoretical writing reflect the desire to avoid discourse that might seem unmanly.”
Interestingly, while some female authors do participate in the paradigmatic
“manly” discourse (e.g., Nolan 1995), it is notable that only twelve of the fortytwo articles authored (or coauthored) by women concern either Schenkerian
theory, set theory, or serial music (28.6 percent of the articles by female contributors), a significantly lower percentage than that in the general population of articles (43.8 percent).
Considering JMT’s practice of having stronger relations with mathematics than with other fields in the humanities, it is reasonable to situate music
theory (as practiced in the journal) as a discipline at the periphery of the
humanities. It hardly ever influences the main disciplines of the humanities
such as literary and historical studies, and it is slow (and occasionally reluctant) to borrow their influence. For example, no article in JMT invokes gender studies, which are today ubiquitous in general musicology. But gender
studies have been undertaken by music theorists. For example, the sessions of
the Society for Music Theory in the 2000 Toronto mega-conference “Musical
Intersections” included five papers in feminism/gender studies (out of eleven
proposed) (Jay Rahn 2001). Their total absence from JMT (at least from the
articles) is emblematic of the journal’s conservative interest in the “nuts and
bolts” of music theory and of the looseness of its connection with the mainstream of humanities.41
Postmodernism, a broader trend in the humanities, is more a general
approach than a field of knowledge, and as such it has wider applications than
gender studies. Since Joseph Kerman’s famous complaint that musicology
ignores postmodern thought (Kerman 1985), postmodernism has penetrated
music scholarship (as in Kramer 1995), but the change concerns more historical musicology and less analysis and theory. Nevertheless, metatheoretical
studies did penetrate JMT in relatively recent years. The inception of this trend
can be traced precisely to the “theory colloquium” in issue 33/1. Of the fifteen
metatheoretical essays, only four preceded this colloquium, although certain
earlier articles discussed philosophical aspects in the history of theory (e.g.,
41  See similar comment by Dunsby (2002, 5) on the absence
of gender studies in Music Analysis.

Yosef Goldenberg 

  Journal of Music Theor y over the Years

Clifton 1970 on Goethe and Schenker). The “new music theorists” are sensitive to aspects of disciplinary discourse, such as the use of metaphors (Mead
1999), which formerly remained unnoticed. Although focus on metatheoretical issues might turn music theorists away from indulging in the music itself
(as Browne 2003 warns), in a journal as conservatively inclined as JMT, this
danger is probably not very strong.
The forceful trend of postmodernism has penetrated JMT to a limited
extent, and thus softens the relationship of JMT to the sciences, which, in the
climax of the modernist approach (e.g., in Boretz [1969–73] 1995), had been
considered desirable. The current intellectual climate encourages a descientification of Schenkerian and other aspects of music theory. Despite this,
however, we can detect with neo-Riemannian theory a scientification process
similar to that undergone by Schenkerian theory a generation previously and
described by Rothstein 1986 (1990). Just as this process split Schenker’s philosophical background from his music theory, so the current state of affairs in
neo-Riemannian transformational theory found in the journal ignores Riemann’s philosophical background.
Other Types of Articles

The forty-two articles that are not ordinary “essays” in my counting include
four bibliographies, fifteen translations of theory treatises, three technical
reports, four replies (discussed above with other marginal documents), and
eight analysis symposia (twenty-three pieces that appeared as sixteen items,
discussed toward the end of the present article). The corpus of “essays” alone
is definitely more uniform than the entire corpus, which also contains these
other types of so-called “articles.”
The four bibliographies that appeared in JMT include two lists of translated treatises (Coover 1959, 1969) and two of Schenkerian studies (Beach
1969, 1979). In the following decades JMT did not publish further bibliographic updates, and there is currently no place for bibliographies in print
journals. However, Beach did publish two further updates of his Schenkerian
bibliography in other print journals (Beach 1985, 1989), and recent Schenker
bibliographies have appeared in two full-length printed books (Ayotte 2004,
Berry 2004).
The fifteen translated treatises that appeared in JMT are very heterogeneous. Their origin ranges from Ancient Greece (e.g., Mathiesen 1975) to
the twentieth century (Clarkson 1984). Translations appeared mainly in JMT’s
early period (average volume: 18; six of the fifteen translations appeared in
the first decade). Some translations have been surpassed by later ones. For
example, Schenker [1926] 1968 was surpassed by Kalib 1973 and later by
Schenker [1926] 1996.
The few articles I identify in my database as “technical reports” (e.g.,
Hiller 1963) are not so described formally. These articles report in a rather

49

50

J our n a l o f M usi c T h e ory

practical manner on the equipment in specific laboratories for electronic
music and, even more than the other articles on electronic music, became
outdated rather quickly.
The eight analysis symposia discussed the following pieces (in chronological order): Mozart, Minuet K. 355 (issue 10/1); Schubert, Moment Musical, op. 94/1 (12/2 and replies in 13/1 and 13/2); Beethoven, Piano Sonata
op. 53, second movement (13/2); Brahms, In Melodien, op. 105/1 (15/1–2);
Webern, Orchestral Pieces op. 13, first movement (18/1 and 19/1); Debussy,
Pour les Sixtes (piano etude) (22/2); Brahms, Alto Rhapsody (27/2); and, after
many years, Cole Porter, “Night and Day” (43/2). This project opened very
intensively, became less frequent, and eventually all but ceased. (The analysis
symposium in the present issue was not included in the bibliometric study.)
The contribution in 43/2 is exceptional not only in repertoire but in essence
as well. Whereas the earlier symposia discussed one work by several methods,
here each scholar examined another version (Shaftel 1999 on the original
song; Larson 1999 on improvisations by Oscar Peterson; and Strunk 1999 on
a Chick Corea performance).
The seven earlier symposia addressed five tonal works from the ClassicRomantic repertoire, one atonal work, and one transitional (impressionistic)
work. Most of the chosen pieces do not invoke unique problems, albeit the
Mozart minuet is much denser texturally and chromatically than is the norm
with Mozart. The four earliest symposia were later reprinted in Yeston 1977
under the title Readings in Schenkerian Analysis and Other Approaches. The title
is emblematic of the then-emerging status of Schenkerian theory as the ultimate method to analyze tonal music. Three of these four symposia included
one Schenkerian analysis and one or two analyses using other approaches.
Read in the perspective of the reprinted title, it almost seems as if Schenkerians were attempting to demonstrate via these analyses the superiority of their
method over competing approaches that were later neglected. The collection
of several analyses of the same piece in various approaches is more instructive
for comparing the analytical tools than for evaluating the piece itself. By contrast, when several analyses of the same piece in the same method appeared
(Schenkerian readings of Schubert’s Moment Musical, op. 94/1 in Schachter’s
contribution within Hughes, Moss, and Schachter 1968, and the replies by
Rothgeb [1969] and Schachter [1969]), comparing the analyses illuminates
the piece rather than the method. That the Debussy symposium consisted of
Schenkerian analyses alone, exploring how the existing analytical tools could
work with such a piece rather than examining alternative methods, is emblematic for the centripetal process of establishing two methods only at a certain
stage in the life of JMT.

Repertoire Discussed in Journal of Music Theory

I have ascribed 408 period records to all 393 articles. The articles in JMT
are devoted mostly to the classical Western tradition. Very few articles discuss
other repertoires. Besides the analysis symposium on a Cole Porter song mentioned above, a single recent three-article symposium (in issue 49/2, outside
the studied database) addresses jazz music—a project previously unthinkable
in JMT—and only eight articles discuss non-Western or traditional music of
various cultures (Chinese, Indian, Arabic, Cuban, Ladino). Of these, two do so
in a comparison with the Western canon (Thomson 1958 and Powell 1979).42
The articles on non-Western music become even less frequent in JMT’s later
periods. The limitation to Western art music is not indicated in the journal’s
title, nor is it self-evident. In an age when the Society for Music Theory opens
interest groups in jazz and even popular music, their absence from JMT suggests a solid conservatism, as well as a certain cultural stance.
Table 6 provides a detailed view of the number of articles per period, but
it might be more instructive to take a broader view and examine the three largest categories of Western music history: early (pretonal) music, tonal music,
and modern (posttonal) music. The separation is not always justified since the
border periods are related (e.g., Clough 1957 on Renaissance and Baroque
music), but few articles cross period boundaries. Most of the articles that do
not address a special period discuss theoretical aspects that might be relevant
to any kind of repertoire, for example, acoustics or metatheoretical issues.
Tonal music and posttonal music are discussed in almost total separation from
each other. David Lewin is exceptional in grasping general phenomena that
have tonal as well as posttonal manifestations (for example, Lewin 1998a on
contrary motion between the bass and the upper voices in Liszt and Crumb).
Among the three large categories, the numbers of articles are 43 (10.9 percent) for early (pretonal), 136 (46.2 percent) for tonal, and 121 (30.8 percent) for modern (posttonal) music. Early music was much more prominent
in the journal’s earlier periods. The decline of early music studies in JMT
is even stronger if one also takes into account the decrease in discussion of
Baroque music (only eight articles on early music, Baroque included, since
vol. 41). This decline might derive from the absence of a paradigmatic theory,
comparable to Schenkerian or set theories, for the analysis of pretonal music
and also from changes in the general balance in historical musicology.43 The
fact that the recent issue 47/2 lacks any items on nineteenth- and twentiethcentury music again points to a possible shift of emphasis after the break in
actual publication of JMT.

42  Powell 1979 is not indexed in RILM.

43  Kerman (1985, 42) notes that prewar European musicology laid stress on the Renaissance and Middle Ages.
This emphasis still dominated in early postwar American
musicology.

  Journal of Music Theor y over the Years

Within tonal music, most noteworthy is the recent rise in analysis of
Romantic (especially late Romantic) music. This rise too seems to result from
the establishment of a matching method (in this case neo-Riemannian theory); the special issue 42/2 is responsible for part of this increase.
The matching between theoretical methods and periods discussed is
fairly high, but not absolute. Five articles use Schenkerian theory to investigate posttonal music (e.g., Nolan 1995), and two additional articles discuss
posttonal music from a wider Schenker-related approach. The complementary method is the application of set theory for tonal music in at least four
articles (most notably in Clough 1979). Whereas the long and problematic
history of Schenkerian applications to posttonal music is heterogeneous in
character (see the survey in Straus 1997b, 237–38, note 1), application of set
theory to tonal music is based on the principle of generalization: applying the
idea of set-classes to the diatonic universe rather than to the chromatic one.
Additionally, the rediscovery of Riemann seems to owe much to set theory.
Riemann’s idea that major and minor triads relate to each other by inversion
seemed of little relevance to Schenkerians as well as to traditional harmonists
such as Piston, but in set theory it is the private case of set 3–11. This aspect
of set theory assisted a new theoretical branch with a different intended repertoire. Here, too, generalization could prove useful, as when Lewin (1998b)
uses transformational theory in an analysis of Bach, by applying the general
idea of flips not to 3–11 but to another trichord, 3–2.
There are large differences between the analyzed repertoire and what
is commonly known as the “standard” repertoire. Although modern music is
given somewhat less space in JMT than tonal music, it still receives much more
attention than it receives in the standard concert or broadcasting repertoire.
Within modern music, the gap is even more striking, as is evident from Table
7, which shows the choice of composers to which entire articles are devoted
(the table is organized according to the chronological order of births, and
thus avoids stylistic categorization).
Ninety-three articles are devoted to the work of specific composers (with
three articles referring to two composers each, a total of ninety-six entries).
These include all sixteen entries in the analysis symposia; inconsistencies in
the input of the symposia create some disproportions but do not modify the
large picture.
The two composers who receive the largest number of articles (with ten
and nine articles, respectively) are Schoenberg and Webern. The absence of
Berg is puzzling, surprising, and perhaps inadvertent since reviews are devoted
to books on his music (e.g., in Hall 1987) and examples from his music are
discussed (e.g., Väisälä 2002). Seven articles address composers of considerable modernity (Dallapiccola, Xenakis, Penderecki), some of them Americans
(Ruggles, Carter, Crumb, Martino), and one article (Johnson 1993) studies

music by the minimalist composer John Adams. By contrast, more traditional
twentieth-century composers receive much less attention: only two articles are
devoted to Bartók, Hindemith appears as a theorist but not as a composer, and
neoclassical composers (e.g., Prokofiev, Shostakovich, or Poulenc) or postRomantic ones (e.g., Sibelius or Elgar) remain outside JMT. Even a full-text
search in JSTOR reveals (until vol. 45) very few entries on these composers
(13, 11, 3, 16, and 2, respectively). The numbers include such irrelevant materials as back matters––including one of the two appearances of “Elgar.”
Composers of the tonal classical tradition are seriously underrepresented in the list I have given since many examples from their works appear
mixed within larger articles. A JSTOR full-text search in JMT reveals 335 items
that include the name “Beethoven” and 281 with “Mozart,” but Haydn is
still represented less than Webern (151 items mention Haydn, 215 mention
Webern). It is nevertheless surprising that 47.5 volumes of JMT do not include
any article specifically devoted to composers such as Handel, Mendelssohn, or
Schumann, to name three.
Studies of most French, Italian, and Russian composers are also absent
in JMT, as are studies of opera.44 The choice of the tonal repertoire in JMT

opera, see Abbate and Parker 1989.

confirms to a large extent the preferences of Schenker, just as the most analyzed posttonal composers lend themselves best to a set-theoretical approach.
Theoretical aspects in the study of tonality or atonality are demonstrated as a
rule by pieces of the common repertoire (tonal or atonal) alone. When a different repertoire is taken, as in McNamee 1985 on Szymanowski or Harrison
1991 on Reger, the analytical examination of the specific repertoire becomes
the main issue.
This is of course emblematic of the constant tension between theory
and analysis in general.45 Along with the ninety-three articles devoted to specific composers, many additional articles analyze musical excerpts, mostly
as a demonstration of theoretical points (which, in turn, should illuminate
musical works). JMT seems slightly more inclined toward theory than toward
analysis. This was very much evident in the journal’s earliest period. Until issue
10/1, JMT included not a single article devoted entirely to one composer or
one work, and only one article that was mostly concerned with one composer
(Rochberg 1959 on Schoenberg). Probably as a reaction to this approach, JMT
initiated the series of analytical symposia discussed above, where the musical
focus was put on specific musical pieces.
Conclusion

Content analysis of the articles in JMT, combined with additional bibliometric
inputs, has proved illuminating for the study of JMT. Whereas most of the
discovered features might be obvious to devoted readers of JMT, the use of
bibliometric methods helps to show the apparent as well as more concealed
features with more exactitude. It is my impression that although the content
of JMT generally reflects the field of music theory in the United States in
general, and that content analysis of additional American periodical literature
in music theory would produce generally similar results, JMT seems nonetheless more conservative than other theory journals (e.g., in its approach to
popular music studies). JMT, the solid house of hard-core set and Schenkerian
theory, nevertheless has become more pluralistic in recent years. It is the task
of future contributors and editors to maintain the delicate balance between
broadening the scope of the inquiry both in repertoire and in method, and
preserving the journal’s highly rigorous theoretical and analytical levels.

45  Even articles with analytical focus might use the musical examples as demonstration of theoretical points. For
example, Beach (1994, 2) claims: “To demonstrate, three
excerpts from Schubert’s chamber music have been cho-

sen. It is instructive to compare in this respect the titles
”
of several other journals in the discipline: Music Analysis
versus In Theory Only, and the compromise in Theory and
Practice.
