tion. The term 'bar' will be retained exclusively for referring to the actual
notational unit of a given piece.
Riemann's next two principles concern the internal construction of the
period. It is composed of two four-measure phrases, antecedent and consequent, with some kind of homogeneity in their materials. Further, the
cadences of these phrases are produced by chords or chord progressions
that are felt as complementing one another. Criteria for such a complementary relationship are problematical. The four permutations of full and half
cadences (dominant and tonic, tonic and dominant, weaker and stronger
tonic, weaker and stronger dominant, e.g., cadence on or in the dominant)
are certainly complementary, but Riemann sees other possibilities as well.
His analyses, both in the System and in later works, show a variety of
cadences on degrees other than the dominant and tonic, and he feels compelled to justify some of these:
" . . I warn here once and for all against attachingtoo strictly conceived notions to the fourthand eighth measure. In general the eighth measure is nothing more than the value answering the fourth, surpassing it
therebyin weight. That it would be necessary for it to bring about any kind
of definitive close cannot be positively asserted. It is clear, though, to be
sure, that as its proportionsgrow, the answering member is increasingly
likely to lead to an ever more noticeable resting point." (System, pp. 20001, my translationand emphases.)
The tone of the statement even more than its content indicates how vexing
the problem of complementary cadences was for Riemann.
Finally, Riemann regards it as axiomatic that the above-described organization of the period is the logical outgrowth of the inherently anacrustic
nature of music. According to this doctrine of Auftaktigkeit-I will make
no attempt to find an English equivalent for this term-the smallest unit of
musical energy is the measure-motive. It begins with a growth phase in the
anacrusis, reaches a central point of stress in the downbeat (thesis), and
this is followed by a decay phase leading to a weak beat (arsis).'6 Occasionally the final arsis of one measure-motive may also serve as the starting
point for the anacrusis of the next one. The same kinetics apply, according
to Riemann, to the larger temporal units of the period as well. Thus the thesis of the first measure-motive within a two-measure segment (Zweitaktgruppe for Riemann, volkommenerEinschnitt for Koch) is anacrusis in this
sense to the thesis of the second, the first segment in a four-measure phrase
(Halbsatz for Riemann) is anacrusis to the second segment, and the antecedent phrase is anacrusis to the consequent phrase. This hierarchy may
continue to the double period and possibly further but with lessening practical significance. Example 1 is a schematic representation of Riemann's
prototypical period. The symbol U shows the arsis; single, double, triple,
and quadruple dashes show the heirarchy of theses.
337

In accordance with the idea that answering values surpass in weight the
values they answer (see the previously cited passage), all units of
Riemann'speriod are accented at the end. The only form of musical motion
recognized by Riemann as natural is the iamb. How pitches and harmonic
factors enhance this motion form is discussed sometimes by Riemann in
connection with particular analyses, but he does not construct any cohesive
theory concerning their role. The closest I can come to identifying the
assumptions guiding him in this regard is to suggest that within the phrase
this iambic, or rather anacrustic, motion is normally supported by harmonic change of some sort from the penultimate to the final measure and
often also from the initial to the second measure. Neither part of this rule
is, however, without numerous exceptions, nor is it possible to deduce any
consistent rule concerning the nature of harmonic changes in question, or
for that matter the role of harmony in setting apart units on different levels,
such as segments and phrases, from one another.'7As we shall see in a little while, Koch provides somewhat better guidance in this respect.
From this theory Riemann develops an analytical shorthand employing
the numbers from 1 to 8 for the eight discrete values of the period. The
shorthand is useful even for those who would alter, as I will, some of the
criteria for the choice of numbers. The numbers 8 and 4 denote, respectively, the final and medial cadences; 7 and 3 stand for the measures leading up to these; and 5-6 and 1-2 denote comparable initial pairs of
measures to which the cadential pairs provide the answer. When a given
period contains more or fewer measures than eight, the numbers show the
precise nature of the extension or the elision. Within the period they may
indicate which values are extended by elongation, which others by repetition (non-literal and sequential repetitions included), and which values are
elided, either simply left out or contracted (e.g., 4=5, 8=1, 8=5, etc.).
Two other kinds of extension may occur as additions to a phrase or a period
complete in itself. They are the preface (Vorhang) and the appendix
(Anhang). The former is one or more measures preceding the phrase proper, often a fanfare, as the first two-bar measure in the Third Symphony of
Beethoven.'8 For prefaces Riemann uses the number 8 by itself, for according to him-and he may well have a point in this - they are perceived as the
final measure(s) of a preceding unstated period (in my own analyses I will
also use these symbols, but I will circle the number(s) denoting such prefaces, and not only when they stand by themselves, but also when they are
actually final measures of a preceding phrase or period). The appendix is
one or several (literal or non-literal) repetitions of a cadence after a fully
stated period or phrase, and it may include one or several shifts to other
scale degrees (Kadenzverschiebung). Appendices are denoted by repetitions of the number 8, or 8(=7) - 8, or 8(=6) - 7 - 8, even 8=5 - 6 7 - 8, etc. When Riemann finds a phrase standing by itself, that is, one that

reverse, and all are adopted by Riemann, albeit sometimes with a different
nomenclature.24
Of greater importance is the third area of divergence between Koch and
Riemann, their respective positions in regard to phrase-ending cadences.
For Koch, phrases normally end on either the tonic or the dominant (Grundabsatz and Quintabsatz). The fourth degree, for instance (and other
degrees by implication), is not suitable for a cadence, " . . . for such triads
seem to be unable to give a quality of completeness to the thoughts that end
with them."25 Only modulating phrases may end on other triads, but in
these cases the final is actually either the tonic or the dominant of the new
key. Koch states the norm here, as is his avowed purpose throughout his
treatise in all other matters, and adds immediately an example to show an
exceptional phrase which ends on the subdominant triad and "which our
feeling judges to be fairly complete."26 One may, however, judge the force
of the norm, when one considers that the phrase given as the exception is
the only one of its kind among all the examples in the Versuch, whether
composed by Koch or anyone else.
The last and most importantarea on which views of the two theorists do
not coincide concerns covert change of meter within a composition.
Neither of them addresses the issue as a separate topic, but both deal with
it in some form or other. Koch lists "equality of meter and similarity of
tempo" among the conditions under which phrases may be connected with
each other to form larger periods?7 This would suggest the requirement
that the same meter be maintained throughout a composition. Yet he
presents two particularly intriguing examples in which phrases in 2/4 and
2/2 follow one another. In the first of these, part of an aria by Koch's own
teacher, Christian Gotthelf Scheinpflug (1722-70), Koch invites the reader
to guess the special reason for this expansion of the meter: the words in the
2/2 phrase are "in Langen, langen Trauertonen."28The second is so
instructive that I shall cite it here in Example 2?9
The example is a portion of a principal period. According to Koch'scomment, the first six notated bars contain twelve 2/4 measures, the meter
changes to 2/2 for bars 7 through 13, and back to 2/4 for the last two bars.
In modern terms the example can be described as an excerpt from a sonata
exposition. Bar 1 is the concluding segment of a phrase the beginning of
which is not given; bars 2-3 contain a phrase in four measures, modulating
to the dominant; bars 4-6 confirm the modulation and complete the first
theme group in a phrase extended to six measures (1-2-la-2a-3-4); bars
7 to the downbeat of bar 14 present a full parallel period in 2/2 time, which
is the first full member of the second theme group; and the rest of the example (bars 14-15) contains appendices to this theme in 2/4 meter. For Koch,
the example illustrates a "special kind of parenthesis . . . the insertion of
melodic sections of a simple meter [2/2] in a piece composed in a compound meter," that is, in C, which is for him the compound of two real 2/4
341

measures, and he goes on by cautioning the student to exercise great care
in the use of this technique "if good taste is not to be offended." What is
a special practice for Koch, strikes the latter-day student as that frequent
procedure of metric expansion and contraction which characterizes, according to at least one modern observer, a great deal of music in larger forms
of the Classical period. As Edward T. Cone writes:
Even within a single tempo not all partsof a movementprogressat the same
speed. It is this changing rate of progression, ratherthan the multiplicityof
musical subject matter, that is basic to the bi-thematic and polythematic
forms of the period.30
It is not easy to summarize fairly Riemann's position vis-a-vis covert
meter change. On the one hand, in allowing for it he goes beyond Koch and
reflects late 18th- and 19th- century practice. On the other hand, he falls far
short of making the insight expressed by Cone an integral part of his system. Taking the Beethoven Sonatas one at a time, for instance, he finds
such prolonged stretches of metric expansion-contraction in the development section of the first movement of Sonata No. 2, (Op.2 , No. 2), also
in the exposition of the first movement of Sonata No. 5 (Op. 10, No. 1), but
then not again until the first movement of Sonata No. 21, ("Waldstein,"Op.
53), where he identifies the first theme group as being essentially in twobar measures (correctly, in my opinion), and changes to single-bar measures in the notated meter C for the beginning of the second group. In the
remaining sonatas he diagnoses metric changes somewhat more frequently
than in the earlier ones, but he seems to feel the need to argue every one
of these cases separately, as if they were anomalous, and fails to develop
any cohesive set of principles by which such covert meter changes could be
systematically identified in analysis.
Riemann's analyses thus show him to be aware of that aspect of the temporal organization of music, which I will call its pacing. On the subsequent
pages "pacing"will always refer to that "changing rate of progression" from
one thematic entity of a larger form to the next which Cone speaks about.
As can be seen in the Koch excerpt cited in Example 2, also in Beethoven's
"Waldstein"Sonata as analysed by Riemann, this changing rate of progression is accomplished primarily by a change in the rate of harmonic progressions (in the Schenkerian foreground or middleground) and results in de
facto metric change. Although Riemann does take occasional cognizance
of changes in pacing in this sense, he nevertheless sees the temporal organization of music, as does Koch, almost exclusively in terms of changes in
what I will call "musical density." As used on the following pages, the term
"musical density" refers to that property of the temporal organization of
phrases, periods, appendices, and extended anacruses, which is a function
of their internal construction. Density is considered greatest in basic
phrases and periods without a preface or with at most one measure of a

sion does not occur until the end of the next six-bar unit. Bars 1-12 and
13-24 are thus seen not as periods but as phrases.
This leads to interpretations2 and 3, both in 6/4 time. Each six-bar unit
now would contain three true measures, that is to say, the period would still
be a tre battute in the unacceptable sense of the term. Interpretation2 starts
out with one bar of an anacrusis and continues with pairing together bars
2-3, 4-5, etc. The result of this barring can be eliminated on a technical
ground alone-our sense of harmonic rhythm is turned upside down by the
cadential six-four chords falling on arses in bars 11 and 23. Not impossible
but similarly grating are such features as placing the high d"s in bars 5 and
17 on arses and placing an accent on the a' of bar 22, a note tied over from
bar 21. In a different context this tied a' may possibly be heard as an intensification of accent through syncopation, but in the actual context the superior force of the cadential six-four chord following in the next bar (bar 23)
disallows this interpretation. The figure of the three quarter notes presents
somewhat more complicated interpretive problems. The figure is clearly
anacrustic in bars 1, 7, 13, 19, and 25. This may suggest at first that interpretation 2 derives a modicum of support from the bass which contains this
figure in bars 5, 17, and 27 and a related figure in bars 11 and 29. I believe,
however, that the melody exerts greater control over the perceiver's sense
of meter. We tend to accept Haydn'streatment of the bass as a subtle witticism (leading to further witticisms in all four voices in the last two six-bar
units) but we tend to reject the necessity of assuming that the figure of three
quarter notes is always an arsis at the beginning of a segment and always
a thesis in the middle of it as too mechanical and too crude.
As for interpretation3, which is to pair all odd-numbered bars with the
even-numbered ones following them (1-2, 3-4, etc.), no technical objection exists, but the esthetic ones are even more severe, at least in bars 1
through 18. Having the repeated quarter-note figure as a thesis seems perverse to begin with, and then alternatingthis figure with the related quarternote figure beginning on an arsis is as grating here as it was in interpretation 2. Perhaps most ludicrous is the effect of placing metric accents on
almost every one of the ornamental neighboring chords (bars 3, 9, 15, 21)
as if they were all appogiature. None of these things are impossible in themselves, but heard repeatedly and in conjunction with each other they counsel rejection of this interpretationas well, particularly in comparison with
the one given in Example 3. The 9/4 interpretation contrasts with the
others in that the figure of the three quarter notes is usually an anacrusis,
as expected; most ornamental. neighboring chords fall on arses, as
expected; cadential six-four chords fall on theses, as expected; and the
whole accentuation pattern requires no special effort on the part of the
performers-it hardly goes beyond what a synthesizer would automatically
produce. Similarities between this case and those argued in the System convince me of the practical value of Riemann's position, even if they do not

main types. The branle double consists of two plus two so-called doublestep units performed to four-measure strains of music in 4/4 time; the
branle simple regularly alternates double- and simple-step units to music in
4/4 plus 2/4 time; the branle gay is in ternary meter like a galliard; and
branles coupes are irregular and unpredictable mixtures of the first two
types. Branles coupes are danced very fast, to music in which 4/4 measures are coupled either with other 4/4 measures or with 2/4 measures, and
the musical sources show that the odd 4/4 measure is not a rarity either.7
The bonny brawl resulting from this last type-recommended by Arbeau
only for the very young-must have been a sight to behold. Whether a listener hears a branle simple such as the one given in Example 5a as one normal long measure plus one truncated measure, or the other way, as one
extended plus one normal short measure, is a moot point. It is, however,
easier to hear the 4/4 measure as normal in the branle coupe given in Example 5b, because they outnumber the 2/4 measures. A 2/4 measure may be
heard truncated even when in fact it extends rather than shortens the phrase
in which it is found, as in Example 5c. Many other examples could be cited
to demonstrate a dizzying variety of methods of extension and elision as
well as the delightful doubt they generate in the perceiver's mind as to
whether they are in fact elisions or additions. Even before branles begin to
appear in 16th century prints, the effect of their metric construction is
already to be detected in chansons of the 1530s, for instance, in the "D'ou
vient cela" of Claudin de Sermisy, one of the hit tunes of the century, given
in Example 5d.38
It is clear, however, that branle-triplets, whether in extended or truncated measures, constitute segments at most, never phrases; and it is
equally clear that they originate in, and fit into, the carrure system much
more directly than Riemann's "truncated-phrase"
interpretations. Their historical importance can hardly be overestimated, for they permeate not
only 16th-century chanson composition from Claudin to Lasso, but find
their way into all kinds of music, then and later, composed by musicians,
most of whom are quite unaware of the 16th-century prototype. Froberger
is particularly fond of them and so are French musicians throughout the
last four centuries in general, not to mention Haydn and Mozart. It is worth
noting that those two of Koch's six examples for six-measure phrases which
he does not himself derive from Vierers, are in fact composed of such
branle-triplets. I give these in Example 6a and b, so that they may be compared with a particularly sophisticated use of the same device in a strain
from the slow movement of Beethoven, Sonata in C, Opus 2, No.3, given
in Example 6c.39
Of the four different analyses in Example 6c the first three are mine, and
the fourth is Riemann's. Only the first, interpreting the antecedent as two
branle-triplets and the consequent as a four-measure phrase joined to the
antecedent by cadential overlap, is correct. Bars 1-6 and 6-9 are both

phrases, as they both contain the requisite tonal progression. My other two
analyses are given only for the sake of argument. The second one assumes
bars 7-9 to be a Takttriole,but not a branle-triplet analoguous to bars 1-3
and 4-6, for the accent pattern is weak-strong-weak. I rule it out on the
basis of a Riemannian principle stated by him time and again in many different contexts: "This interpretation is not impossible, but as it may well be
unnecessary, it is of course false."40 My third analysis can be ruled out on
the same ground. It could be accepted only if the continuation would somehow justify it, which is not the case here, as the reader may verify by consulting the score. I reject Riemann's analysis on the grounds that there is
no conceivable reason to consider bars 1-6 as a.complete period in two
truncated phrases rather than a single phrase with one tonal progression in
it (I-III). Further, his interpretationdoes not highlight here the kind of contextual feature that justified it in Example 4a. It seems both overly ingenious and superfluous; my first analysis can be substituted for it without
difficulty and to more telling effect.
In Example 6c the long measures of the branle-triplets are extensions.
In the first strain of the Menuet of Mozart's G minor Symphony, K.550,
and in the strain cited previously from his String Quintet (Example 4a)
they are felt as normal 6/4 measures followed by foreshortened 3/4 measures. I give my analysis of these two Mozart excerpts in Examples 7a and
7b to show that interpreting the consequent phrases of these in 6/4 time
(i.e., in two-bar measures) fits into Riemann's system much more easily
than do his own analyses. While I do not reject Riemann's analysis of the
Quintet (Example 4a) I consider the one in Example 7b a valid alternative.
If it is not conspicuously simpler, it has the advantage of showing that the
final portion of the strain, bars 56-62, contain a pair of cadential appendices, that is to say, a passage of lesser musical density than the full period
preceding it. I believe this to be a musical fact at least as important as the
one Riemann is attempting to show when he calls attention to the origin of
the first six bars of this Trio in the last six bars of the Menuet. The contortions of his analysis of the Symphony (example 7a) are a direct consequence of his doctrine of Auftaktigkeit-a heavily accented beginning must
be an even numbered measure-of his reluctance to assume in practice
covert meter change, and of his general preference for shorter rather than
longer units as the true measure. In view of Riemann's position vis-a-vis
passages in ritmo di tre battute his preference for shorter measures in other
contexts seems paradoxical.
Examples 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 demonstrate that two of Riemann's schemas
dealing with three-bar units have much to recommend them. Takttriolen
and the assumption of large ternary measures for passages in ritmo di tre
battute are useful concepts in a system based on carrure. His third schema,
however, interpreting three-measure units as phrases with their first measure missing is most of the time both unnecessary and confounding. It may

be discarded from his system without loss, and my schema of branletriplets may be profitably substituted for it. Branle-triplets are always segments, not phrases, whether they result from the extension of a measure,
as in Example 6c (and as we shall see later in Example 13a), or from the
foreshortening of a measure, as in Examples 5b, 7a, and 7b (and as we
shall see later in Example 8a).

THE LENGTH OF THE PHRASE DETERMINED BY CADENCES AND
THE PATTERN ACCENTS. The remaining two correctives or revisions
OF
of Riemann's system are intended to serve as criteria for determining the
length of the phrase and thus the length of the true measure defined earlier
as one fourth of the phrase when extensions and elisions are left out of consideration. From a practical viewpoint the first of these, adopting Koch's
norms for phrase ending cadences along with his implied principle of at
least one tonal change per phrase, is the more important of the two, and
needs only minor qualifications. Accordingly, some form of full and half
cadences is the rule, but modulation may shift the cadence to other degrees
of the scale. The progession V-VI is acceptable as a weak tonic cadence,
but when it occurs at the end of the period it should normally be followed
by a cadential appendix that supplies the actual tonic, as is the case at the
end of Examples 3 and 4b, where these special appendices are felt to
belong more organically to the period proper than do such appendices
which are added to a period after a full tonic cadence. A rare exception will
be shown in Example 9a, in which the antecedent phrase ends on the supertonic yet "our feeling judges [the phrase] to be fairly complete" because all
other conditions of period construction are satisfied.
It is only on account of some problems in its practical application that
the second criterion for determining the length of the period may seem to
be of lesser importance than the first. The second is indispensable as a complement to the first, but its very nature requires qualifications that are more
complex and more extensive than those needed for the first. Caution dictates that the practical observation underlying this working hypothesis be
stated first: A period will be certainly perceived as a period, whenever it
contains at least one perceptible irregularity in the pattern in which
stronger theses alternate with weaker theses (hereafter st and wt). Both the
hypothesis and the observation underlying it may be expressed graphically
by freely adopting the technique of durational reduction advocated by Carl
Schachter.4 In a durational reduction graph each actual measure is
reduced to a single beat (usually the quarternote or the dotted quarternote)
and the beats thus obtained are grouped into hyper-measures. When barring is so used as to create one hyper-measure per phrase, two types of patterns may result: either | C st - wt - st - wt I and its variant form C st wt - | - st - wt, or the Riemannesque patterns C wt - st - wt - I - st and
355

C wt - I - st - wt - st. According to my hypothesis, either a switch from one

to
type of pattern the otherwill normallyoccurfromthe firstto the second
of
will
hyper-measure one period,or else a syncopation occurin one or the
other (or both) of the two hyper-measures.
It can be seen that rigorous applicationof this workinghypothesis
types of

Withthe two criteriathus statedin abstractterms, we may proceedto
356

concrete examples. The primary concern of Examples 8 through 12 is with
such musical entities in which one meter is clearly established. This is normally the case with theme statements. Since, however, Example 11 contains an entire sonata exposition, such aspects of larger forms as covert
meter change and metric ambiguity, the latter a characteristic of transitional passages, will also be discussed. These and other aspects of larger
forms will be more fully examined in connection with Example 13.
The two themes that begin the two theme groups in the first movement
of Mozart's much analysed G minor Symhony, K.550, are given in Examples 8a and 8b.43They were chosen because they provide a fairly typical
illustration of the validity and usefulnes of the two criteria as well as of the
kind of arguments their analysis with Riemann's method entails. Applying
the first criterion yields rather straightforward and immediate results in
both themes. In Example 8a the I chord in bar 9 and V in bar 16 suggest
4/2 meter in two-bar measures; the cadences of example 8b, V in bar 47
and I in bar 51, show the latter to be in the notated C meter. The 4/2 meter
in Example 8a is further confirmed by the caesura in bar 5. Since this is
on a II chord in four-two position, it separates segments, not phrases. The
opening theme is expected to continue beyond bar 9 and would be expected
to do so even if the cadence were made stronger, say, by adding a d bass
note in bars 7-8 and leading the melody in some pedestrian way to the
tonic; the theme in Example 8b gives every indication of being complete
after eight measures. What the cadences suggest in regard to meter is born
out by applying the test of st - wt alternation. In the first nine bars of Example 8a harmonic rhythm and low bass notes clearly show that the oddnumbered bars are theses, the even-numbered ones are arses, and that the
unit is a phrase. For the limited purpose of establishing the whole theme
as a period, one does not need to determine which of the theses are
stronger in the antecedent phrase, for clearly some kind of syncopation
occurs somewhere in bars 10-13, because theses shift from odd-numbered
bars to even-numbered ones for bars 14 and 16. Complexities can be
avoided, at least for the time being. Equally simple is the case in Example
8b. The cadential six-four chord renders the tonic accent on the thesis of
bar 47 stronger than that of the preceding bar, and this strong thesis is
immediately followed by another strong thesis in bar 48. The strength of
the latter hardly needs to be argued-it is a long note on a previously established beat, it is the highest note of the theme, and its harmony is the pungent non sequitur, a subdominant chord following a dominant. Further
inquiry is not necessary, the requisite irregularity in the pattern of st - wt
alternation becomes sufficiently clear. Either the first phrase is syncopated,
or if that phrase is assumed to begin with a wt-a highly dubious
proposition-a shift from one type of pattern to the other occurs from antecedent to consequent.
Application of the two criteria brings us thus far in the analysis of the

two themes. The second half of Example 8a must be approached by other
avenues. Since we know already that bars 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and bars 14 and 16
are theses, and that a half-measure is missing somewhere in bars 10-13,
the simplest solution is to count back three two-bar measures from bar 16.
The resulting analysis, adopted in Example 8a, indicates that it is the first
anacrusis of the consequent phrase that is shortened by the missing halfmeasure. As this is now only one quarter note long, rather than five quarter
notes long as are the anacruses to bars 3, 5, 7, and 9, the branle-triplet is
located in bars 7-9. Testing this attractive interpretation against all other
possible analyses given in Examples 8c-1 through 8c-4 will turn out to be
of more than academic interest. The first two of these are based on the
unlikely assumption that the meter has changed somehow at bar 10 to the
notated 2/2 (C). Example 8c-3 proceeds from the tenable assumption that
the pattern of theses in the odd-numbered bars continues for a while
beyond bar 9. Indeed, nothing within the four bars 10-13 indicates whether
the diminished four-three chords in bars 10 and 12 are anacrustic arses or
appoggiatura-like theses vis-a-vis the tonic six-chords in bars 11 and 13.
Example 8c-3 assumes further that the third segment of the period (i.e.,
true measures 5 and 6) is elided, and thus the seventh true measure (bars
11-12) is repeated in varied form (bars 13-15) with its second half elongated. All three of the above analyses contain forbidding complexities.
They may be rejected outright on the basis of Riemann's dictum "possible
but unnecessary and therefore false." In contrast, Example 8c-4 presents a
viable alternative to the analysis in Example 8a. Both contain all four true
measures of the phrase, both take all pitch events and all rhythmic events
into account, and minor details do not give us unequivocal indication
whether the metric continuity of the period should be interrupted by a
branle triplet at the beginning or in the middle of the consequent phrase.
Choice between these two interpretations is not easy, for each has at
least one feature to recommend it over the other. A listener's tendency to
stick with an established pattern until forced to change favors Example 8c4. Yet a certain element of consistency that can be observed only in the context of the entire period gives a slight edge to the interpretationin Example
8a. The melodic and durational reduction graph of Example 8d shows this
context. In the graph rhythmic values are reduced fourfold, and the
melodic as well as harmonic content of each actual bar is represented by a
quarter note (occasionally subdivided) constituting the substance of the bar
in question. The first four full hyper-measures contain the four segments of
the period, the rest of the graph shows the cadential appendix and the anacrusis to the (varied) repeat of the theme. The harmony in bars 20-21 indicates that this unit is a gavotte-like anacrusis, and identifies thereby bars
1-2 also as such. Consequently the barring given underneath the system in
Example 8d cannot be right, and is rendered even less likely by the unwarranted separation of the identical a-g quarter-note pairs (bars 10-13) as
360

parts of two different hyper-measures. On the basis of the graph the entire
theme can be seen as four pairs of melodic (though not necessarily harmonic) appoggiature and their resolutions, d-c, c-bb, a-g, and g-f#. The
first two pairs of notes, d-c and c-bb, and the last pair, g-fl, will certainly
be heard as melodic appogiature. A quest for consistency may, therefore,
make the perceiver understand-or want to understand-the a-g pairs also
as appogiature. This would render the interpretation given in Example 8a
preferable to the one in Example 8c-4. Nevertheless, the choice between
them must be considered idiosyncratic. It depends on whether the esthetic
goal of a given performance is to emphasize or to de-emphasize an irregularity that is there in any case.
If the analysis of Example 8a was argued at some length, this was
because its purpose was not only to demonstrate application of the two revisions to the Riemannian method of determining phrase length, nor was it
only to find the best interpretation(s) of a given musical entity, but also to
demonstrate the operations of the method as such. As a number of issues
have already been covered, briefer treatment will suffice to deal with the
remaining examples. Example 9 presents two themes in which medial
cadences raise the question whether these themes are indeed periods or
only phrases. In Examples 10 and 11 three themes will be examined in
which cadences allow (or seem to allow) various interpretations, and in
which only the pattern of wt - st alternation is capable of deciding the issue.
Finally Example 12 contains two themes of a movement, the second of
which has a sufficiently elusive accent pattern to allow two equally valid
interpretationson a considerably larger scale than was the case in Example
8a.
The first member of the double-period constituting the entire second
theme in Brahms, Intermezzo in B-flat minor, Opus 117, No.2, is given in
Example 9a. The theme is in D-flat major, it has its medial cadence on the
supertonic, its final cadence is on V of the submediant, yet it is clearly perceptible as a full period for every other condition of period construction is
satisfied. The two four-measure phrases produce the requisite symmetry,
the material is homogeneous, the cadences are complementary, and the
antecedent hyper-measure is clearly syncopated.44The st - wt - wt - st pattern is hardly in doubt. The first measure is stronger than the next two
which are only varied repetitions of the first, and the fourth is strong again,
not only because it is an appoggiatura, but because it contains the only
change of harmony and the only change in rhythm in the entire phrase.
Applying the same kind of reasoning to the opening theme of Beethoven,
Sonata in G, Opus 14, No. 2, given in Example 9b, leads to the opposite
conclusion. This theme is only a phrase (and since it stands by itself, without antecedent or consequent, the numbers 5 to 8 are used for its analysis,
in keeping with Riemann's practice). Despite its symmetry and its material
homogeniety it is not a period, because the supertonic cadence of bar 4

In
theses display the constant st - wt pattern throughout.45 this instance, the
constancy, taken together with the nature of the musical materials, suggests
an extended phrase in 2/4 time rather than a basic phrase in 4/4 time, for
the first three two-bar pairs are free repetitions of each other, and any of the
three pairs could form a complete phrase when combined with the final segment in bars 7-8. Interpretationin 4/4 time gives no account of the cumulative effect of these repetitions, but the analysis adopted in Example 9b
does, and is also in line with two of Koch'sextended phrases given in Example 9c and d. His explanation for the first of these is worth citing:
" .... The punctuation formula of the second [segment] may be made the
same as the punctuation formula of the first . . . Then the first phrase in
[the] example is made incomplete, and the second phrase, even though complete in itself, is yet necessary to finish the first. By this means, two complete phrases are given the form and value of a single integral phrase, that
is, they are compounded."46Two comments need to be added to Examples
9a and 9b. Cases analogous to the Brahms theme are rather rare in the
music of other 18th- and 19th-century composers, and cases that are analogous in some way to the Beethoven theme are usually best interpreted in
double-bar measures (as we have already seen in Example 8a and will see
in further examples).
In the next group of themes (in Examples 10 and 11)an over-abundance
of possible cadence points places the burden of decision almost entirely on
the pattern of st - wt alternation. Example 10, the theme opening the slow
movement of Beethoven, Sonata in C, Opus 2, No. 3, is particularly intriguing, for the perceiver who only hears the music (or reads it from an unbarred score) discovers its true meter only gradually, in three distinct stages.
At the first stage three different meters, 2/8, 2/4, and 4/4 (see dotted bar
lines) are all possible, and as is shown in analyses 2 and 3, the last two
meters are capable of being heard in either a thesis-arsis or in an arsisthesis pattern (to reject a priori the arsis-thesis pattern would be as precipitate, I believe, as would be assuming it by preference, as Riemann does.)
The only thing a listener can be sure of at this point is that in case the beat
is the quarter note, the thesis of the first bar (whether on the first or on the
second quarter note) is stronger than the one in the second bar, for the second bar is but a free repetition of the first. This fact will be the more readily remembered by a listener, as the same condition obtains throughout
bars 3-4 and 5-6, the second stage. All that happens at this second stage
is the elimination of analysis 1, for the perception of 2/8 time cannot be
maintained in the face of four pairs of regularly repeated accent patterns (in
bars 1-4). The quarter notes are thus established as beats, although we still
do not know which one is the arsis, which one the thesis.
It is only in the third stage that the exceptionally strong accent on the
first beat of bar 8 resolves all ambiguities on every level. The strength of

this accent derives only in part from its being a cadential six-four chord.
The principlal reason for its paramount force is that the accents of the preceding bar are only implied-they are all but obliterated by syncopation
(which prevent us from knowing even whether the tied sixteenth notes are
weak eighth notes delayed or strong eighth notes anticipated). Thus we
know not only that the first beat of bar 8 is a thesis in relation to the arsis
of the second beat, but also that within the segment of bars 7-8 it is the
strong thesis. We now realize that a thesis-arsis assumption throughout the
first six bars was the correct perception all along, and not the arsis-thesis
one of analysis 3, which is now eliminated. Further, we also realize that the
st - wt pattern noted throughout in the first three two-measure segments is
giving way in the fourth segment to the wt - st pattern which eliminates the
possibility of a 4/4 interpretationand creates the sycopation in the second
hyper-measure (i.e., bars and true measures 5-8) that establishes the
theme as a period in 2/4 time. The cadential appendix in bars 9-11 needs
no other comment than that the elongation of the repeated penultimate measure places a strong accent on the delayed tonic of the repeated final measure (bar 11). Thus this beat, which also begins the theme cited in Example
6d, is assured of being heard as strong.
The two themes in the first movement of Beethoven's "Pathetique"Sonata that are of primary interest for our present purposes are in bars 12-28
and 52-90, at the beginning of the first and second theme groups, respectively. As the musical materials surrounding these themes are pertinent to
their interpretation, the entire exposition is given in the durational reduction graph of Example 11. Actual note values are reduced fourfold in the
graph, that is, each actual whole note is represented by one quarter-note.
Bar lines are drawn to produce hyper-measures in 4/2 meter in bars 1275 and hyper-measures of varying sizes after bar 76. As a visual aid, subdivisions of hyper-measures are drawn in dotted bar lines. My analysis
appearing, as usual, beneath the staves identifies the true measures of any
given part of the movement. The terms "true measures" and "true meter"
in the following discussion must not be confused with either the bars of the
score or the hyper-measures of the graph.
The theme in bars 12-28 is one full parallel period with a preface. The
two halves of it are phrases, not periods. The reason for this is neither the
insufficiency of harmonic-melodic materials to make them periods, nor the
lack of suitable cadence points, but metric properties-the notated bars
alternate regularly in a strong-weak pattern, making us hear eight beats in
four true measures. The alternation is regular also on the level of true measures throughout bars 12-28, but as we now have a parallel period, the
break in the pattern is dispensable. The theme is, incidentally, one of those
in the literature that happens to fit Riemann's Auftaktigkeit, because it
begins with the preface 8, rendering the subsequent first measure a relatively weak thesis and because the wt - st pattern from odd-numbered to
368

even-numbered
measurescan be maintainedthroughoutin this parallel
period.47
The othertheme,in bars52-90, requires
somewhat
morecomplexarguments. Cadenceswith phraseending potentialseem to aboundhere too,
and the hyper-measures also regular,at least up to bar 76. So it would
are
seem that the first portionof this theme (bars52-68) is a parallelperiod
similarto the openingtheme. This is not so, however.The E-flatcadence
in bar 60 is not complemented the D-flatcadencein bar 68, for this is
by
an unexpectedtonal shift away from the tonic key. This portion of the
themeis thusneitherparallelnor a period, and the regularalternation
pattern identifiesit as a phrasein true 4/1 time (i.e., hyper-measures
contain
segmentsonly, not phrasesas before). It requiresthe answering
phraseof
bars 68-90 that providesthe long-expected
returnto the tonic. Unlike in
the antecedent
phrase,in the contextof the entireperiodthe E-flatand the
(earlier)D-flatcadencesnow complementone another.In fact, the entire
themein bars 52-90 appearsto be a specialcase of a parallelperiod, and
as such it could dispense with a breakin the regularst - wt alternation.
Sucha breakdoes occur nevertheless.

pace suggests 2/2 meter as well. Further, the new meter increases our
awareness of the slower pace of both the preceding period (bars 12-28) and
the passage that comes next, in bars 36-51. This new passage may be heard
as resuming (or continuing) the earlier 4/2 time, but since the harmonic
rhythm is slower here than it was in the opening period, the passage may
also be heard in 4/1 meter. The stage is thus set for the double period
already discussed (bars 52-90) at the beginning of the second group. The
second member of the second group (bars 90-102 and 102-114) is a
repeated phrase in 4/1 meter-in view of the absence of a medial cadence
no other interpretation is possible-and what follows is perhaps the most
remarkable feature of the movement, the remainder of the exposition
accomplishes a metric contraction that systematically reverses the earlier
metric expansion. Bars 114-118 (and 118-122) are in their ambiguity analoguous to the passage in bars 28-32 (and 32-36) and lead to the return of
the opening phrase in extended form, which re-establishes, if only by association, the true 4/2 meter of the beginning. The design that results is
unique to this exposition. In one respect, however, it is typical of all larger
forms of the Classical era from Haydn to Schubert. It gives every indication of being calculated to appeal to our rational sense and it seems to be
executed systematically.
Before going on to explore further implications of metric change and
metric ambiguity in larger Classical forms, one more pair of themes will
be examined for the purpose of demonstrating that two evenly balanced possibilities of metric interpretationmay exist throughout entire large themesand choice between them means a choice between two conspicuously different practical performances. Once again durational reduction in the proportion of 4:1 is employed in the graphs of Example 12 to show that the
opening theme of the Mozart Piano Concerto in A, K.488, is indeed a
period (actually the first member of a double-period), in which the st - wt st - wt pattern of the first hyper-measure gives way to the syncopated st wt - wt - st pattern in the second. The syncopation is produced, as so often,
by the cadential six-four chord in bar 8. It establishes 4/4 meter both for
the first eight measures and for the largely analagous answering period in
bars 9-16, even though the decisive syncopation is absent from the latter.
The same metric interpretationseems to be applicable to the theme in bars
229-236, shown in Example 12b (these bars correspond to bars 31-38 in
Example 12c). It is clear, however, that because of the lack of a medial
cadence these eight bars contain a phrase only, not a period. Such a medial
cadence could possibly have been produced if bar 232 (=34) had been written differently, for instance if the actual d bass note had been replaced by
an e and if the continuous figuration of the melody had been interruptedat
a suitable point. As it is, however, emphasis is on the passing character and
on the continuity of all harmonic and rhythmic-melodic elements (if these
are separable), and no phrase ending cadence is heard until bar 236(=38).

Example 12 (continued)

373

The group of examples presented on the last few pages (Examples 8-12)
may also be considered from the viewpoint of the practical effect their anlaysis has upon actual performance. In the B-flat major theme of Mozart's
Symphony (Example 8b), the opening theme of his Concerto (Example
12a), the Brahms theme (Example 9a), the opening theme of the Beethoven
G major Sonata (Example 9b) and the three themes from his "Pathetique"
Sonata (Example 11) the performer has no choice-only one correct interpretation is available. In the slow movement of Beethoven's C major Sonata
(Example 10) several choices seem possible at first, but at the end only one
solution fits all the musical facts. An interpretation that reflects from the
beginning the metric decision dictated by the final segment is certainly correct, but a performance that carefully avoids the metric decision in the first
six measures is as good and may indeed be superior. A performance, on
the other hand, that flirts inadvertantly or on purpose with those metric
interpretations that turn out to be incorrect as the theme progresses is
wrong-headed. The transitional passages of Beethoven's "Pathetique"
(Example 11)offer genuine interpretive alternatives but no choice in the tangible matter of accentuation. One performance may differ from another in
nuances, for instance, how much music will be played in one breath, or
how small or how large the minute deviations from metronomic time will
be. These are important from the viewpoint of the total musical experience, and yet, since ambiguity inheres in these passages, the logic of one
alternative may be as compelling as that of the other.
The case is a little more complicated in the opening of the Mozart Symphony (Examples 8a and 8c-4) where a genuine choice between two possible accent patterns is offered in bars 10-13. Even if one of these is
considered superior to the other-and I for one do not find it easy to decide
on principle whether rigorous logic is always preferable to flight of fancythe doubt generated by these possibilities is such an important part of the
esthetic experience, that it seems almost mandatory for a performer to
avoid making the choice clearly perceptible. Because of the brevity of the
passage in question, this is much easier to do here than in Example 10. The
decision, however, cannot be avoided in the theme at the beginning of the
second group of the Mozart Concerto (Examples 12b and c). An attempt to
do so-unlikely to succeed in view of the length of the passage-results de
facto in a choice for that metric interpretation which continues the previously established pattern. It would seem logical to continue the preestablished pattern in both the orchestral tutti and the solo exposition-or
to discontinue it in both places-in which case the accent pattern of the
theme itself cannot be the same in both places. It would be, however,
equally logical to keep the accent pattern of the theme identical both in the
tutti and in the exposition, which requires that the pre-established pattern
continue in one place but change in the other. The logic of one considera374

favored.
Since the second groupcontainsno problematic
analyticaldetails, the
analysisof this expositioncan now be examinedas a whole. The variable
and elusive metric organiztion the first group is of paramount
of
importancefor the entireexposition.It providesbotha sharpcontrast the overto
all metricstabilityof the secondgroupand an intriguing
link betweenthe
two groupsat the same time. Those two-plus-one one-plus-two
and
juxtapositionsthat rendereven the openingof the firstgroupelusive are found
in the second groupexclusivelyin what is clearly connectingtissue. The
themes of the second group are so stable that the first of them, in bars
the
46-53, can evenaccommodate anacrusis
figureof bars3, 5, 7 (andanalogous bars)in a metricallystrongposition(in bars48 and 52, also 59 and
63). Althoughthe otherthemein this group,in bars 82-86, allowstechnically two differentanalyses, the distinctionbetween the two is without
difference.The accentpatternis clear enoughby itself, it is reinforced
by
the similarity this themeto the one in bars 18-21,andthis time the unacof
380

cented position of bar 85 (the anacrusis figure) is further reinforced by
Beethoven's dynamic markings in the varied repetition of this phrase in
bars 87-90 which make it impossible to place any kind of an accent on bar
89. Thus the hyper-measures are not subject to doubt. The exceptionally
clear definition of hyper-measures throughout the group render even the
connecting tissue less equivocal than is the case in the first group (or for
that matter in the exposition of the "Pathetique,"as shown in Example 11).
We hear bars 54-56 primarily as a cadential extension. Their interpretation
as a phrase is distinctly secondary, even though as a phrase the passage is
a recognizable metric reference to the first group. Similarly, bars 65-71
and 72-82 are perceived primarily as cadential appendices that develop
these metric references yet further. On the secondary level, bars 65-72
may possibly be heard as some kind of a period, but bars 72-82 are so stagnant harmonically that even on that level they do not constitute a phrase,
merely two hugely extended measures subdivided in the metric style of the
first group. All these metric references in the connecting tissue of the second group are exaggerations, perhaps playful exaggerations, of the genuine
complexities of the first group. Playful or not, however, their function is allimportant from the viewpoint of overall form. They tie the two theme
groups together as securely as any motivic realtionship would and, conversely, they would be without rhyme or reason in any other context.
The other important conclusion that may be drawn from applying
Riemann's adjusted analytical method to this exposition concerns its proportions. A count of bars would make it seem that the two theme groups
are about equal, 45 and 43 bars long, respectively. This is very much like
saying that two statues are equally tall without saying that one represents
the Christ child, the other Saint Christopher. The first group with its two
larger phrases and two smaller phrases followed by an extended phrase of
an appendix and by one more phrase (or even one more period) of an even
more extended bridge is decidedly longer than the second, containing only
two larger phrases separated by a cadential extension and followed by two
cadential appendices that lead to two more smaller phrases. The six or
seven phrases in the first group certainly outweigh the four phrases of the
second, and this could be expressed also in terms of true measures. A
count of the longest possible (i.e., minimum number) of true measures
shows the first group 21 measures long and the second only 18, but a count
of the shortest possible measures is more realistic, showing the two groups
to be 34 and 24 measures long, respectively. The pacing of the music is
laid bare.
To sum up what we learned from analyzing this Beethoven exposition
with Riemann's adjusted method we may proceed in the order from least to
most important results. Finding the similarity among various entities, such
as bars 18-21 and 83-86, is relatively trivial (and discoverable even without the method). Finding the kind of detail such as the metric play that
381

placesthe anacrustic
figureof bars3 and5 into a metricallystrongposition
in the second group seems more significant.Findingthe metric relationship betweenthe first groupas a whole and the connectingtissues of the

16. In using "thesis"to denote the downbeatand "arsis"the weak beat, I conformto standard American practice. Some writers, such illustrious authoritiesamong them as

386

Bela Bart6kand KnudJeppesen, adhereto the opposite usage, which is closer to the
Greek meaning and to the usage in quantitativepoetic meter.
17. There are fewer exceptions to the first part of the rule, requiringharmonic change
from the penultimateto the final measureof a phrase, than to the second. One is the
firstphrase(in four two-barmeasures)of Beethoven, Sonatain A, Opus 2, No.2. An
phrase in the first four bars of Beethoven,
exceptionto both partsis the four-measure
String Quartet in G, Opus 18, No.2, containing just two harmonies, I-I-V-V.Yet
Riemann's
deducedprincipleappearsto be vindicatedby the free repetition,or rather
of
reformulation, this theme in bars 9-20. In this the repeatedantecedentphrasecontains both times I - V (four-three)- I - V.
18. Unlike most other types of extension found in Riemann, prefaces are not discussed
by Koch under a separate heading. Koch neverthelessexplains this construction in
connection with two examples in the Versuch(2:379-80 and 381-82, Introductory
Essay, pp. 17 and 18, examples 49 and 54-55). The readerwill find other instances
of it in Examples 8a and 11. In the latterthe preface actually ends the last phrase of
the introduction
and is at the same time the first measureof a new period. The opening six bars of Beethoven, SymphonyNo. 5 may be cited as an interestingcase of a
double preface.
19. I adopt this practice in the presentstudy. Distinction between themes consisting of a
single phraseand those of two-, three-, and four-phraseperiods is one of the important form-shapingtools in most music, particularlyso c.1770-1830. It is also something of an historical criterion, for single-phrase themes are so frequent in the
decades before 1770 as to constitute the norm, and they become comparativelyrare
after Beethovenand Schubert(with Brahms, as usual, the exception).
20. Carl Schachter in his "Rhythmand Linear Analysis, Durational Reduction," The
Music Forum, V (1980), 203, notes that in the present day musical vernacularthe
term "phrase"
usually denotes "a unit of tonal motion as well as of duration."This
usage is applicableto Koch'sexamples but not always to those of Riemann.
21. Examples 361-62 in the Introductory
Essay, (pp. 163-65, Versuch,3:226-30) show
the extension of a 16 measure principal period (four four-measurephrases in 2/4
time, notatedin eight C bars) into a sonata exposition. Koch also identifies the first
section, i.e. the exposition, of a symphonyas a principalperiod (Introductory
Essay,
p. 199, Versuch,3:304-5).
22. For three of these see Examples 2 and 9c and d below.
23. Accordingto Koch, such genuine five-, six-, and seven-measurephrasesmust be distinguishedfrom other phrasesof the same length, "becausethe formerrequiredifferent treatmentfrom the latterin joining of [several]phrasesand periods"(Introductory
Essay, p.14, Versuch,
2:374). There is hardlyany follow-upon this observationin the
furthercourse of the Versuch.For two examples of six-measurephrases that are not
derived by Koch from basic four-measurephrases see Examples 6a and b where I
show that these, too, may be so derived.
24. Only Koch's so-called "parenthesis,"("Parenthese,"and "verwickelterSatz") discussed briefly in the IntroductoryEssay, pp. 53-4 and 160-163 (Versuch2:460-63
and 3:218-26) does not reappearin the System. This involves various ways in which
"unessentialmelodic ideas"are insertedbetween parts of a single phrase. For a special case of parenthesissee example 2.
25. Introductory
Essay, pp. 36-7, Versuch,2:415-17.
26. Bars 3 and 4 of this example outline the harmonies I and IV. An accompaniment

387

could easily convert the I chord into V of IV. In the "modulating"
example that follows it is precisely this conversion that is brought about by melodic means. Koch
states that "such [modulating]phrases appear very frequently,"and adds that "one
in
must consider it as a I-phrase(Grundabsatz) the key of F, to which the melody has
been led throughthe tone B flat," ratherthan as a cadence in C on the IV-thdegree.

29. Introductory
Essay, pp. 162-63; Versuch,3:223-25. The symbols of a squareand a
triangle are used throughoutthe Versuchto show the endings of phrases and segments, respectively. Koch considers two-measure segments (Einschnitt, in Baker's
translation"incise")complete, one-measuresegments incomplete. Two (or more) of
the lattermay be substitutedfor one complete segment within a phrase.In the present
exampleKoch marksalmost all phraseendings, but only those segments that are relevant to his commentary(in which a few errors had to be correctedby Baker in the
translation).I have supplied all missing symbols in brackets.

31. Typicalof Riemann'sreactionto this chargeare the wordsthat begin his introduction
to the Practical Guide to TheArt of Phrasing, 1890. "'Toocomplicated!'is the watchword among the opponents of the new phrasing marks. With this 'weighty' word,
musicians'turn
serenly and haughtilypronounced,the majorityof 'university-taught
their backs on a reformwhich aims at relief, and would fain hush it up. Fafnercrawls
back to the Neidhole: 'Let me sleep'" (p. III). The introduction
closes with an "appeal
to all who take the matterof phrasingto heart, to apply themselves theretodiligently
thatthey may be able to participatein the great work .. "and with the assertionthat
no element of the work is arbitrary(p. IX).
32. Riemann's
views on ternarysegmentsare scatteredover the pages of the System. The
zwischaptersdealing with them in greatestdetail are Grosse Triolenand Widerspruch

33. The second and thirdbars of these phrasesconstitutetheir second true measure. The
five-bar scheme for these phrases is kept intact in all Brahms'svariations, but the
extension is fashioneddifferentlyeach time.

is the 8th edition of the Katechismusder Phrasierungof 1890.

a veritableanthologyof dance-musicof the entire period, as it is piratedin large part
from variousprintsof the precedingdecades. The analysis of the strainof the Mozart

of
36. A particularlyinterestingexample is Brahms, Intermezzoin B-flat, Opus 76, No.4.
It is an A-B-A form in two-barmeasures.The first A section is composed of a period
of one three-measure one four-measure
and
phrase, in bars 1-13(14),with appendices
added in bars 15-20. Since bars 5-6 are heard as a medial cadence, it appears as

388

if the first true measure were missing. This impression is confirmedby the recapitulation. The period in bars 33-45(46) is here preceded by another measure in bars
31-32 which is clearly the first measure of a two-measuresegment; thus it supplies
the measure that was missing from the beginning. The case is rathercomplex, for
bars 31-34 functionnot only as the firstsegmentof the recapitulated
period but simultaneously also as the final segment of the B section. A somewhat similar but considerably simpler case of missing opening measures is provided by Mendelssohn,
Lieder ohne Worte A, Opus 38, No.4. In this A-B-A form (framedby an introducin
tion and a postlude) we hear a period in two-plus-fourmeasures (bars 4-9, repeated
in 10-15). After the B section (bars 16-19) A is recapitulated,this time, however,
with bars 20-21 adding the two measures that were felt to be missing in the antecedent phrase. The first A section is thus seen in retrospectas havingbegun with the
properthird measure.
37. In 16th-century
sources of dance music neitherthe temporaof mensuralnotationnor
the bar lines of tablaturesprovide a reliable guide in groupingbeats togetherto form
musically meaningful measures. Barring of transcriptionsin modern notation is,
It
therefore,necessarilya matterof interpretation. is usually not difficultto isolate the
six beat segments in branles simples and coupes, but subdividingthem can be problematic at times. In many cases, perhapsthe majorityof them, subdivision into fourplus-two beats is supportedby musical forces, but two-plus-fouris not unusual, and
can
three-plus-three also be foundon occasion. There are even a few branles simples
in which a steady 3/2 meter seems preferableto a 4/4 + 2/4 interpretation,
resulting
in ritmo di tre battuteof the kind found in Example 3. The tunes cited in Example
5 and their analyses requirethree more comments. Note values are reduced in each
of them so as to make the quarternote the beat of the transcription,regardlessof
whetherthe sources give the semibreveor the minim as the beat unit. In the analyses
I have used the numbersfrom 5 to 8 to indicatethat the basic unit is the four-measure
phrase ratherthan the eight-measureperiod (usually the case in dances of the 16th
century,except in settings of one or anotherof the eight-measureharmonicgrounds,
such as the PassamezzoAntico or Moderno, the Romanesca,etc.). Finally, no source
known to me designatesArcadelt'schanson "Margot" a branle coupe. I identify it
as
as such only on the groundsof its metric structureand of its markedmelodic similarity to scores of French branle tunes.
38. The chanson was first published by the Parisian Pierre Attaingnantin 1531 (RISM
15312)and reprinted frequently in various forms throughoutthe century. Symon
Cock uses its tune for his translation Psalm 72 in 1540,and Clemens adopts it from
of
Cock for the polyphonic setting of this Psalm in the Souterliedekens(modernedition
KarelPhilippusBernet Kempers,ed. Jacobus Clemens non Papa: Opera Omnia, II,
1952, p. 53).
39. The period precedingthe one in Example 6c is analysed in Example 10.
40. BeethovenSonatas, 3:158, my translationand my emphasis. It is with these words
that Riemann rejects an analysis he has considered for the beginning of the second
movementof the Sonata in F-sharp,Opus 78.
41. In his "Rhythmand Linear Analysis, DurationalReduction,"Schachterhas devised
this method"to reveal connections between durationaland tonal organization... in
some types of music"(p. 198). Althoughrelatingactual music to a four-measure
prototype is not Schachter'sprimary purpose, his analyses reveal such a relationship
more than once. Wheneverhis hyper-measures
comprise entire phrases, they are in

389

an st - wt - st - wt pattern.This reflectsSchenker'sview that phrases normally begin
strong and come to rest on a weak thesis. It is the easier to accept this view as it is
held with no trace of the unfortunate
dogmatismthat characterizesRiemann'sopposite view.
in
Structureof Music, Cooper and Meyer warnthat
42. Characteristically, The Rhythmic
in the face of the absence of any consensus concerning mattersof rhythmtheir work
is intendedas a startingpoint ratherthan a formulationof a comprehensivetheory (p
V). Their caution is echoed in almost all writingson the subject to date. Particularly
and Linear Analysis, A Prelimeloquent is Schachterin statinghis doubts ("Rhythm
inary Study,"pp. 299-311) concerningthe possibility of such a general theory and in
obstacles in its way.Yeston,too, concludes the Stratificadealing with some particular
tion of Musical Rhythm,with a chapter(pp. 148-53) carefully delineatingthe limits
of his own theory and addressingcertain difficulties that face any general rhythmic
theory.
43. The analysis presented in Lerdahl and Jackendoff,A Generative Theory of Tonal
Music, pp. 21-25 and 258-60, is of particular interest from the viewpoint of the
present study.
44. Consideredby itself, this period may not show its materialhomogenietyas conspicuously as it does when it is viewed in the context of the entire piece. The four-note
motive at the beginning of the period is a rhythmicallysmoother version of the one
permeatingthe entire firsttheme. Thus even the casual listeneris alertedto the importance of both the motive and the technique of rhythmic transformation,and will,
therefore, experience no difficulty in recognizing the motive in the consequent
phrase, where it appearsin augmentedand metrically displaced form.
45. Schachter("Rhythmand Linear Analysis, a PreliminaryStudy,"pp. 326-27) makes
the material homogeniety of this theme more readily apparent. He reduces the
rhythmof the six-note motive of the first four bars to eighth note (anacrusis)-eighth
note (thesis)- quarternote (in syncopation),thus showing its relationshipto the rhythmic patternof bars 7 and 8 and to furtherrecurrencesof this patternin the first theme
group.
46. IntroductoryEssay, p. 57, (Versuch, 2:458-60). I have substituted 'segment' for
'incise'in Baker'stranslationfor the sake of keeping the terminologyconsistentin the
present study. Baker'susage is, of course, amply justified in the context of Koch's
work.
47. Riemann analyses this exposition in two-bar measures throughout. My analysis
agrees with his only up to bar 28. It is worth noting that in shapingthis theme Beethovenhad other options before him. A minimumof re-composingcould renderbars
18-19 and 26-27 final measures ratherthan penultimates.Werethe resolutionof the
six-fourchordof bar 18 to come at the beginningratherthan in the second half of bar
19, and were the six-four chord of bar 26 to resolve on the second half of that bar to
be followed in bar 27 by a tonic chord, a grammatically
correct eight-measureperiod
would result. It would not begin with the preface8 but with the simple cadentialoverlap 8=1, and the cadences would be in the measures of bars 18-19 and 26-27.
Beethoven'ssolution in manipulatingthe surface events of these measures so as to
carrythe phrasesbeyondthem to the theses of bars 20 and 28 may be seen as a grammatical choice of significantesthetic consequence.
48. In the recapitulation theme (bars222-54) is not extended. As my analysis places
this
true measures(bars 52 and 222, 60 and 230,
strongeraccents on the even-numbered

390

68 and 238, 76 and 246, 90 and 254) there is no break here in the patternof st - wt
alternation. There would be one, however, were the odd-numberedtrue measures
the
assumed to be generallythe strongertheses. Since bar 250, representing thesis of
the true 7th measure, is part of a passing motion from I (246) to V (252) and thus
weak in relationto both 246 and 254, the patternof the consequentphrase is syncopated, st (242) - wt (246) - wt (250) - st (254). Although several considerationsmake
me disinclined to revise the analysis of Example 11, the desirabilityof a break in the
pattern-even though not necessary in this case-could be an argumentfor such a
revision.
49. See note 5, above.
50. In general, ritornelloconcerti from J.C. Bach and Mozartto Beethovenand Hummel
offer a fertile ground for the study of all kinds of rhythmicphenomena, particularly
of metric expansionsand contractions.Bars 19-30 of the tutti of K.488, for instance,
contain a passage in the notatedC measures, which is transformed bars 83-98 of
in
the solo-exposition into a modulatingpassage extended by passage work. From bar
87 on, interpretations C (2/2) and in 4/2 meter are equally valid.
in
51. Donald Francis Tovey, Essays in Musical Analysis, London: Oxford University
Press, 1935, I, p. 40, calls this phrase the first half of a big sentence.
52. In the discussion of'Anffnge mit dem zweiten Takt"(System,pp. 213-220), Riemann
uses the theme in bars 46-54 of Example 13a and b as an illustration.
53. In the System, bar 54 is numbered9 ratherthan 8a. As Riemannexplains, all even
numbers representstrong theses, but only 3 and 7 of the weak measures serve as
growth phases to the strong4 and 8, respectively,5 and the new symbol 9 represent
an "Anschlussder leichten wirklichen Takte an die vorausgehendenschweren," in
other words, they are prolongationsof the decay phase. Their functionis to bring the
numberof measures in the period to eight.
