(Received 14 December 2007; ﬁnal version received 19 February 2008 )
The article studies the problem of generalizing the concept of ‘diatonic scale’ for a given ambient chromatic
of N tones: ‘Which subset A ⊂ ZN shall be considered as a generalized diatonic scale?’ Each generic type
of well-formed scale has exactly two speciﬁc manifestations in chromatic universes, which are large ME ∗ scales, i.e. which are maximally even non-degenerate well-formed scales, whose cardinality exceeds half
of the chromatic cardinality. A qualitative distinction between these two large ME ∗ -scales of the same type
can be comfortably made on the basis of the shufﬂed Stern–Brocot tree, which is introduced in Section 2.
The shufﬂed Stern–Brocot tree represents the same abstract binary tree as the traditional Stern–Brocot tree,
but has a different planar arrangement.
Candidates and ﬁnal choices for generalized diatonic scales are studied in Section 3. Candidates are those
large ME ∗ -scales A ⊂ ZN which are tightly generated by a prime residue class m mod N . According to
this property there is no non-degenerate m-generated well-formed scale W properly included between the
translation T1 (Ac ) of the complement of A and A itself. This property is equivalent to the fact that the
associated ratio m/N is a chromatic number, i.e. that its penultimate predecessor on the Stern–Brocot tree
is a convergent for m/N , which again is equivalent to the fact that the ratio m/N corresponds to a right
branching on the shufﬂed Stern–Brocot tree. Tight generatedness of a large ME ∗ -scale is also equivalent
to the fact that the small-scale step of chromatic size 1 is at the same time also the rarer step, while the large
step of size 2 is at the same time also the more frequent step. A generalized diatonic scale A minimizes the
cardinality difference between |A| and |Ac | among all tightly generated large ME ∗ -scales in ZN . For N
divisible by 4, this deﬁnition reproduces exactly the family of hyperdiatonic scales, as studied by Agmon
(Journal of Music Theory, 33(1), 1–25, 1989) and Clough and Douthett (Journal of Music Theory 35,
93–173, 1991). For N odd we exclude the trivial case of 2-generated scales and obtain a rich inventory of
generalized diatonic scales, such as the 7-generated 11-tone scale in Z19 . An interesting point for N odd
is also the generalization of the tritone as a minimal limited transposition subset.
We show that Ivan Wyschnegradsky has already done pioneering work on this subject (1916). His 11generated 13-tone scale in the quarter-tone chromatic Z24 is a hyperdiatonic scale in the sense of Agmon
(1989) and Clough and Douthett (1991) as above, and his argumentation in favour of this scale anticipates
central points of the discussion in this article.

music-theoretical arguments and explores cross-connections to related work by other authors.
A historically and theoretically interesting source to this question is the preface of Ivan
Wyschnegradsky’s Preludes, opus 22, composed in 1916. In Section 4 we will recapitulate some
of his ideas, which anticipate music-theoretical insights, which were realized and elaborated in
academic discussion several decades later, especially in the work of Eytan Agmon [1] and in the
joint article by John Clough and Jack Douthett [2]. The present article reviews these ideas against
the background of the theory of well-formed scales [3] and recent transformational accounts.
In music theory, a (standard) diatonic scale is a seven-note scale comprising two types of
interval: whole steps and half steps, with the half steps maximally separated. In addition diatonic
scales are obtained from a chain of six successive ﬁfths rescaled in an octave. In the last few
decades, music theorists have studied these properties. John Clough and Gerald Meyerson [4]
introduced the term Myhill’s property to characterize the situation in a scale when each generic
interval comes in exactly two sizes. They studied a class of scales which they called generalized
circles of ﬁfths (see also [5]), The term maximally even (ME) was coined by John Clough and
Jack Douthett [2] to refer to scales that are subsets of a chromatic scale and in a well-deﬁned
sense are spread out as much as possible within that chromatic. The authors observe that not all
maximally even sets have Myhill’s property, and conversely, sets with Myhill’s property are not
always maximally even. Those ME scales that do have Myhill’s Property will be denoted by the
expression ME ∗ . The asterisk stands for a particular arithmetic relation between the cardinality d
of the scale and the cardinality N of the ambient chromatic, namely when they are coprime, such
as 7 and 12. Norman Carey and David Clampitt [3,6–11] studied the concept of well-formedness,
which is one of the most important for investigations in diatonicity. They introduced self-similarity
[6] and showed that any scale with real pitches modulo octave (mod 1) has Myhill’s property if and
only if it is a non-degenerate well-formed scale. A central insight of their theory is the existence
of a linear automorphism of the generic scale which translates the counting of steps into the
counting of generator intervals and vice versa.1 Vittorio Cafagna [14] and Domenico Vicinanza
[15] connected this translation with the concept of winding numbers. Thomas Noll [16] linked
symplectic transformations of integer pairs with continued fractions and developed in [17] a
transformational model for scale states based on the Stern–Brocot tree (see also [12,13]).
The initial context for the determination of a generalized diatonic in a given N -chromatic
universe is provided in terms of the large ME* scales (see Section 3 for details). With the attribute
‘large’ we wish to select those ME scales A, whose cardinality is larger than half of the chromatic
cardinality N : |A| > N/2. This implies that the scale steps have the speciﬁc chromatic sizes 1
and 2. These scales have a generalized circle of ﬁfths, whose generator (“the generalized ﬁfth”)
shall be denoted by m. Under this perspective the scales are non-degenerate well-formed scales
in the broader sense of [3] with the extra property that they are maximally even and large. The
small complements of such scales have no adjacent pitch classes. Conversely, if the complement
Ac of any non-degenerate well-formed scale A ⊂ ZN has no adjacent pitch classes, one may
already conclude that A is maximally even with speciﬁc step sizes 1 and 2 (see Proposition 3.1).
Thus, the task in searching for a unique generalized diatonic scale (up to transposition) in a given
chromatic universe consists in making a choice among the large ME* scales. On the one hand,
we recover Eytan Agmon’s concept of a diatonic scale, for which Clough and Douthett ([2],
p. 123) coined the term hyperdiatonic scale. Such a scale is deﬁned, whenever N is divisible
by 4. The odd diatonic cardinality |A| and the chromatic cardinality N satisfy the equation
N = 2|A| − 2. Ivan Wyschnegradsky’s 13-tone diatonic in a 24-quarter-tone system is an instance
of this particular type (see Section 4). On the other hand, the domain large ME* scales can be
reduced by superimposing a tightness condition for the inclusion of a translation of Ac within
A, which is equivalent to the condition for the ratio m/N , to be a chromatic number. The latter
condition has been proposed by Thomas Noll in [16] as a component in his deﬁnition of pseudodiatonic system. In this investigation Noll combines insights by Gerard Balzano [18] and Eytan

Agmon [19] and connects them with a generalized view on Jean Philippe Rameau’s concept of
double employment. It seems, however, that he was not aware about the tightness condition as a
consequence of his proposal.
The concept of chromatic numbers enters scale theory via the mathematical connections among
well-formed scales, the Stern–Brocot tree and a Cayley graph of the matrix monoid SL2 (N).
Details follow in Section 2, where we depart from the classical Stern–Brocot tree in favour of a
shufﬂed alternative. An inspection of the standard diatonic scale shall ﬁrst illustrate the connection
between the diatonic as a ﬁfth-generated well-formed scale, an associated ratio 4/7 and a matrix

The numerator 4 represents the number of diatonic steps in the generating ﬁfth, while the denominator 7 represents the number of diatonic steps in the octave. The rows (3, 1) and (5, 2) of the
matrix A provide a reﬁnement of information about the multiplicities of whole steps and half
steps: The generating ﬁfth consists of 3 whole steps and 1 half step, while the octave consists
of 5 whole steps and 2 half steps.2 If x and y represent the sizes of whole step and half step,
respectively, we may express the above information more elegantly as a linear equation

The transformation of the initial vector (g, 1)T into the step vector (x, y)T entails an immediate music-theoretical question. The two step types are distinguished by two salient properties:
The whole step is larger and more frequent (occurring 5 times), while the half step is smaller
and rarer (occurring 2 times). How is this related to the above transformation, which formally
characterizes the whole step as a substitution for the ﬁfth and the half step as a substitution for
the octave? Section 2 answers this question in terms of an alternative “shufﬂed” tree-structure
of the Stern–Brocot tree and associated transformations. This modiﬁcation guarantees that the
solution coordinate x always represents the rare step, while y always represents the frequent step.
Furthermore, the shufﬂed tree-structure puts the chromatic numbers in obvious positions.

By the shufﬂed Stern–Brocot tree we mean a different planar arrangement of the same abstract
binary tree. This means that the two successors n1 and n2 of a given node n are the same as in the
original tree, but there is a different criterion for their placement to the left or to the right below
n: the uppermost three nodes 1/1, 1/2 and 2/1 are posed as in the original tree. For any node that
is not the root 1/1, we may then determine the direction of the edge leading to it: either from the
left or from the right. The shufﬂing-principle is given as follows: if a successor n of a node n in
the original Stern–Brocot tree is reached from the same direction as n is reached from its own
predecessor node pre(n), then in the shufﬂed tree n is placed to the left lower side of n, otherwise
it is posed to the right lower side of n.
There is an analogous Cayley graph of a freely generated matrix monoid R, L ⊂ GL(2, N),
which corresponds to the shufﬂed Stern–Brocot tree in the same manner as the Cayley graph
of SL(2, N) corresponds to the original tree, namely via the values of the associated Moebius
transforms at the argument z = 1. The two generating matrices associated with the shufﬂed Stern–
Brocot tree are

It remains to be shown that these matrices represent the same abstract Stern–Brocot tree and that
the Cayley graph of R, L realizes the above mentioned shufﬂing-principle for its planar arrangement. The matrix R is not an element of SL2 (N), because det(R) = −1. We may distinguish
between two cases.
(1) Each matrix A ∈ R, L with an even number of occurrences of R in its generation has
det(A) = 1 and belongs to SL2 (N), i.e. it belongs also to the monoid T , S and consequently
is associated with the same ratio μA (1) on both trees: the original Stern–Brocot tree and the
shufﬂed version.
(2) Each matrix
A=

a

∈ R, L

with an odd number of occurrences of R in its generation has det(A) = −1 and we ﬁnd that
the matrix

with exchanged columns belongs to SL2 (N) = T , S . Although the two associated Moebius
transforms

and

μA (z) :=

differ from each other, we ﬁnd nevertheless that their values at z = 1 coincide: μA (1) =
μA (1). Consequently, A is associated with the same ratio in the shufﬂed Stern–Brocot tree

as is A on the original Stern–Brocot tree.

For each matrix A ∈ R, L let cardR (A) denote number of occurrences of R in its generation.

and σ sends L = T to itself and R to R = S. Note that this bijection is not homomorphic. The
matrices L and R verify the relation L−1 R = R−1 L, while the matrices S and T verify the
relation S −1 T S −1 = T S −1 T .
Instead of homomorphy we need to check the shufﬂing property. Each element in A ∈ R, L
is represented by its word w1 (A) ∈ {R, L}∗ with letters ‘R’ and ‘L’, and likewise each element
in B ∈ T , S is represented by its word w2 (B) ∈ {S, T }∗ with letters ‘S’ and ‘T ’. Let wσ :
{R, L}∗ → {S, T }∗ denote the expression of the bijection σ in terms of words, i.e. wσ (w1 (A)) :=
w2 (σ (A)). What needs to be shown is that whenever in a word w2 (σ (A)) a letter at position k
repeats its predecessor (no matter whether this letter is T or S), then the associated letter in the
−1
word wσ (w2 (σ (A))) = w1 (A) at position k is L. If, however, in w2 (σ (A)) a letter at position k
differs from its predecessor, then the associated letter in w1 (A) at position k is R.
Our sketch of a proof starts with the observation that multiplying a matrix A by T from the
right is the same as adding the left column of A to its right column, while leaving the left column
unchanged, and multiplying a matrix A by S from the right is the same as adding the right column
of A to its left column, while leaving its right column unchanged. This means that, in both cases,
one of the two columns is replaced by the sum of the columns, while the other is still in its
original place. However, multiplication of a matrix A by R from the right is like adding the right
column of A to its left column, followed by an exchange of both columns. Thus, in both cases of
multiplication by L = T or by R from the right, the sum of the two columns ends up on the right
side while one of the summands is ‘stored’ on the left side. As long as we repeatedly multiply
a matrix A with T , we repeatedly multiply σ −1 (A) with L, correspondingly. Once we change
from T to S and thereby change the side of the ‘sum column’ in A · S from right to left we need
to multiply σ −1 (A) with R in order to keep the sum column on the right side. If we now go on to
multiply A · S with S, we need to multiply σ −1 (A) · R with L, because we simply go on further
to increase the ‘wrong-sided’ sum column. Only if we switch back to multiply with T again do
we need to apply R in order to compensate for switching the sides again.
As a consequence of the shufﬂing property we obtain the following characterization of chromatic
numbers. Noll deﬁnes chromatic numbers as positive ratios whose penultimate semi-convergent
is a proper convergent. This means that the associated word on the Stern–Brocot tree has a sufﬁx
ST or T S. In both cases we have a change of the letter in the last position. And this means that
the last letter of the associated word on the Stern–Brocot tree needs to be R. In other words, on
the shufﬂed Stern–Brocot tree chromatic numbers are always right successors.
Scale generators, such as the ﬁfth g = log2 (ω) are usually chosen between 0 and 1. Thus, it is
sufﬁcient to inspect the half wing of the shufﬂed Stern–Brocot tree, which starts at R(1) = 1/2. It
corresponds to the left wing of the ordinary Stern–Brocot tree (depicted by the grey rectangle in
Figure 1) in which the rational numbers of each horizontal line are the same but in another order.
We return to our initial example from the introduction. The node u = RRRL with matrix

Generalized diatonic scales

In the light of our remarks in the introduction, we may characterize large ME* scales as follows.
PROPOSITION 3.1 If a non-degenerate well-formed scale A which is a subset of a chromatic
universe ZN has a complement Ac without adjacent pitch classes it is necessarily a large ME*
scale.
Proof In addition to the maximal evenness of the abstract step pattern of the scale A—which
holds for every well-formed scale—we may further conclude from the lack of adjacent pitch

Journal of Mathematics and Music

27

classes in Ac that this ME pattern is entirely made up of 1’s and 2’s. From this fact we may
conclude that the scale itself is maximally even and large. An ME scale can only be generated if
the generator m and the chromatic cardinality N are coprime, and thus A has to be a large ME*
scale.
If one thinks of a large ME* scale A as the white keys of a maximally even keyboard layout, the
proposition focuses on the property that there are no black keys adjacent to each other. Informally,
we may therefore alternatively speak of a white key scale.

Downloaded By: [Kroger, Pedro] At: 14:05 29 September 2008

Example 3.2 The set A = {0, 1, 2, 3, . . . , N − 2} is a trivial 1-generated white-key scale in
ZN and the set B = {0, 2, 4, . . . , 2k} is a trivial 2-generated white-key scale in Z2k+1 . Both
sets are well-formed and non-degenerate. Ac reduces to one note (one black key). B c is the set
{1, 3, 5, . . . , 2k − 1}, which also has no adjacent pitch classes.
Proposition 3.3 shows that—in general—there are m-generated non-degenerate well-formed
scales that are not m-generated large ME* scales and it shows how they are related with the large
ME* scales.
PROPOSITION 3.3 The cardinality of an m-generated large ME* scale in ZN is maximal among
all m-generated non-degenerate well-formed scales in ZN .
Proof Different m-generated non-degenerate well-formed scales correspond to different speciﬁc
step sizes (in the sense that different scales differ at least in one step size). Proposition 3.1
implies that the speciﬁc step sizes of a large ME* scale need to be 1 and 2, which implies its
maximality.
Example 3.4 In the 14-chromatic universe Z14 , the scale C = {0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11} is a
5-generated non-degenerate well-formed scale. But its complement {3, 4, 8, 9, 12, 13} has adjacent pitch classes. Thus, the scale C is not a large ME* scale. However the scale {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6,
7, 8, 10, 11, 12} is a large ME* scale.
The following proposition (Proposition 3.5) recapitulates a characterization of large ME* scales
its connection with their small ME* complements.
PROPOSITION 3.5 Any large ME* scale A in ZN and its complement Ac are both maximally
even subsets of ZN . A contains a translation of its complement. More precisely, the translation
T−1 (x) = x − 1 of one degree down of the elements of Ac is included in A,
T−1 (Ac ) ⊂ A.
Proof As A is well-formed we can infer that its step interval pattern is maximally even. As the
step sizes of A are furthermore 1 and 2 we may further infer that also step intervals of Ac are
adjacent numbers and that A and Ac are both maximally even well-formed scales. They are both
instances of generalized circles of ﬁfths in the sense of [4]. From [24, Theorem 5.2], we know
that a translate of Ac is contained in A.
DEFINITION 3.6 An m-generated large ME* scale A (m ≥ 2) is tightly generated if there is no
non-degenerate well-formed m-generated scale W with
T−1 (Ac ) ⊂ W ⊂ A.

Before we further investigate this property we will use it in Deﬁnition 3.7 below, which provides
an answer to the initial question implied by the title of this paper: ‘Is there an analogue to the
standard diatonic scale in a given chromatic system with N notes rather than 12?’

Downloaded By: [Kroger, Pedro] At: 14:05 29 September 2008

DEFINITION 3.7 Within a ﬁxed chromatic universe ZN (N ≥ 12, N = 15) the generalized diatonic
scale (or simply the diatonic scale) is a tightly m-generated large ME* scale A (with generator
m > 2) such that it minimizes the cardinality difference |A| − |Ac | among all tightly m-generated
large ME* scales (with varying generators m > 2).
The condition m > 2 takes into account that for odd chromatic cardinality N there is always
a 2-generated trivial generalized diatonic scale A = {0, 2, 4, . . . , N − 1} of cardinality |A| =
(N + 1)/2, with the unbeatably small difference |A| − |Ac | = 1. Eytan Agmon [1] discards these
scales, while John Clough and Jack Douthett [2] acknowledge their role within the construction
of second-order ME sets.3 Deﬁnition 3.7 thus presupposes the existence of tightly generated large
ME* scales with generators m > 2. Above N = 12 there is one known exception, namely N = 15.
Conjecture 3.12 claims that beyond this example there is always a non-trivial generalized diatonic
scale.
Example 3.8 For N = 12, the traditional diatonic scale A = {0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10} is a 5-generated
(or 7-generated) large ME* scale. Its complementary set is the traditional pentatonic scale and is
a translate of the 5-generated subscale {0, 3, 5, 8, 10} ⊂ A, which is a small ME* scale. The only
5-generated set {0, 1, 3, 5, 8, 10} between A and Ac is not well-formed.
Example 3.9 In light of the prominence of the 19-tone chromatic as a tempered version of the
Cembalo Cromatico, it is interesting to note that the tightly 8-generated large ME* 12-tone complement {0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18} of the small ME* scale {1, 3, 6, 9, 11, 14, 17}—
which as a black key scale in Z19 corresponds to the traditional diatonic scale—is not the
generalized diatonic scale in Z19 . Instead it is the 7-generated scale {0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, 14,
16, 18} of cardinality 11.4
The subsequent deﬁnitions and propositions demonstrate the beneﬁt of the shufﬂed Stern–
Brocot tree for the study of large ME* scales. In the introduction we associated the ratio 4/7 and
the matrix
3 1
∈ SL2 (N)
5 2
with the standard diatonic scale. In Section 2 we replaced this matrix by its shufﬂed version
1

∈ R, L .

Recall that the ratio 4/7 is a generic characterization of the diatonic scale: the numerator 4
represents the number of diatonic steps in the generating ﬁfth, while the denominator 7 represents
the number of diatonic steps in the octave; 3 and 1 are the numbers of occurrences of the frequent
and the rare step within the generating ﬁfth, respectively; 5 and 2 are the numbers of occurrences
of the frequent and the rare step in the octave, respectively. This generic characterization does not
tell whether the frequent step is smaller or larger. Later, in Proposition 3.13, we show that, for
m-generated scales, tightness occurs exactly when the frequent step is also the larger one, namely
of size 2.
In extrapolating this concrete situation of the traditional diatonic we may investigate the hierarchy of generic descriptions of well-formed scales with the help of one-to-one correspondences
among ratios on the shufﬂed Stern–Brocot tree, matrices in R, L and generic scale descriptions.

denote the matrix on the shufﬂed Stern–Brocot tree associated with the ratio b/d. On the basis of
these coordinates we obtain a generic scale description: b represents the number of scale steps in
the generating interval, and d represents the number of scale steps in the octave. b0 and a0 are the
numbers of occurrences of the frequent and the rare step in the generating interval, respectively.
d0 and c0 are the numbers of occurrences of the frequent and the rare step within the octave,
respectively.
Deﬁnition 3.10 is merely a shufﬂed version of the hierarchy of well-formed scales according
to Carey and Clampitt [3]. Now, in addition to this generic interpretation, we introduce speciﬁc
one-to-one correspondences among ratios, matrices and certain m-generated scales.

number coprime with N. Let

denote the matrix on the shufﬂed Stern–Brocot tree associated with the ratio m/N and let Am/N =
{km | k = 0, . . . , d − 1} denote the associated m-generated scale of cardinality d.
The following proposition (Proposition 3.12) conﬁrms that this association provides in fact oneto-one correspondences among ratios, matrices and large ME* scales. Furthermore, it provides
a connection between the generic interpretation of ratios in the sense of Deﬁnition 3.10 and the
speciﬁc interpretation of ratios in the sense of Deﬁnition 3.11.
PROPOSITION 3.12 Each m-generated scale of the form Am/N in ZN is a large ME* scale and
every large ME* scale in ZN is of the form Am/N , i.e. corresponds to one node m/N in the
shufﬂed Stern–Brocot tree.5 The generic description of any large ME* scale Am/N corresponds
to the immediate predecessor b/d of the node m/N on the shufﬂed Stern–Brocot tree.
Proof The predecessor of ratio m/N on the shufﬂed Stern–Brocot tree is the ratio b/d with the
associated matrix
b − b 0 b0
Gb/d =
d − d 0 d0
Depending whether Am/N is a left or right successor of Gb/d , we have to distinguish the following
two possibilities:

This shows that all scales of the form Am/N are degenerate well-formed scales with speciﬁc
step sizes 1 and 2, i.e. they are large ME* scales. Conversely, if we are given a large ME* scale,
whose generic description is given by the matrix Gb/d , we may apply this matrix to its step size
vector (2 1)T or (1 2)T in order to obtain

The resulting vectors describe exactly the chromatic sizes of the generating interval and of the
octave for the scales A(2b−b0 )/(2d−d0 ) and A(b+b0 )/(d+d0 ) , which completes the proof.

one ﬁnds G4/5 · L = A5/9 and G4/5 · R = A7/12 . The 7-diatonic scale A7/12 = {0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 11}
in Z12 is tightly generated, while the 5-generated large ME* scale A5/9 = {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7} in
Z9 is not. A5/9 contains the translate {0, 5} of its non-degenerate well-formed complement {8, 4}
with step sizes 4 and 5. And between {0, 5} and {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7} there is the 5-generated nondegenerate well-formed scale {0, 1, 2, 5, 6} with step sizes 1 and 3. Proposition 3.13 below shows
that this binary division in a tightly generated case and one non-tightly generated case exempliﬁes
the general case, namely the binary distribution of large ME* scales (for varying m) along the
binary tree structure of the shufﬂed Stern–Brocot tree.
PROPOSITION 3.13 Let Am1 /N1 = Gb/d · L and Am2 /N2 = Gb/d · R denote the left and right successors of the matrix Gb/d on the binary Cayley graph of the monoid R, L . The m2 -generated
large ME* scale Am2 /N2 in ZN2 is tightly generated, while the m1 -generated large ME* scale
Am1 /N1 in ZN1 is not. In the tightly generated case, the larger step of size 2 occurs more frequent
than the smaller step of size 1.
Proof As
Gb/d =

b − b0
d − d0

b0
d0

is an element of the monoid R, L , we know that b − b0 < b0 and d − d0 < d0 . This implies
that the chromatic cardinality N1 = (d − d0 ) + d is smaller than the chromatic cardinality

N2 = d0 + d. It also implies that the number d − d0 of steps of size 2 in Am1 /N1 is smaller than
the number d0 of steps of size 2 in Am2 /N2 . Thus, to complete the proof, it remains to be shown
that the right successor corresponds to a tightly generated scale, while the left successor does
not. The crucial point is that the cardinalities of the complements Ac 1 /N1 = ZN1 \Am1 /N1 and
m
Ac 2 /N2 = ZN2 \Am2 /N2 coincide with the frequencies d − d0 and d0 of the steps of size 2 in Am1 /N1
m
and Am2 /N2 , respectively. This is simply because in each size 2 gap there sits a black key—an
element of the complement.
The predecessor of the ratio b/d on the shufﬂed Stern–Brocot tree is b0 /d0 . Consequently, b0 /d0
is a semi-convergent of both ratios m1 /N1 and m2 /N2 . In accordance with the theory of wellformed scales [3] we may conclude that the m1 -generated scale B1 = {km1 | k = 0, . . . , d0 − 1} of
cardinality d0 within ZN1 is a non-degenerate well-formed scale. Likewise, the m2 -generated scale
B2 = {km2 | k = 0, . . . , d0 − 1} of cardinality d0 within ZN2 is a non-degenerate well-formed
scale. The complement of Am2 /N2 also has cardinality d0 and therefore B2 is a translate of Ac 2 /N2 .
m
But d0 is larger than the cardinality d − d0 of the complement of Am1 /N1 . Thus, on the one hand,
we have a proper inclusion T−1 (Ac 1 /N1 ) ⊂ B1 ⊂ Am1 /N1 , which shows that the left successor
m
Am1 /N1 = Gb/d · L is associated with a non-tightly generated scale. On the other hand, a proper
inclusion T−1 (Ac 2 /N2 ) = B2 ⊂ B2 ⊂ Am2 /N2 of well-formed scales would imply that there is an
m
intermediate semi-convergent of the ratio m2 /N2 between b0 /d0 and d/b. But there is no such
intermediate semi-convergent and therefore the right successor Am2 /N2 = Gb/d · R is associated
with a tightly generated scale.
Example 3.14 For N = 13, the number m/N = 5/13 is associated with the word RLR 3 and
the matrix U. The predecessor on the shufﬂed Stern–Brocot tree is 3/8 and is associated with the
word RLR 2 and the matrix V
U = RLR3 =

The generalized diatonic scale A is the 5-generated large ME* scale A = {0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12}.
Its complement is, up to translation, the scale B = {0, 2, 5, 7, 10}. There is no well-formed scale
between A and B. The scale A is tightly generated. The word RLR 3 associated with m/N ends
by R. The ﬁrst column of the matrix U is equal to the second column of V. Instead consider now
the number m/N = 3/13, whose associated word is RL3 RL. This is associated with the matrix
U = RL3 RL =

The 3-generated large ME* scale A = {0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12} is not tightly generated. Its complement is, up to a translation, Ac = {0, 3, 6, 9}. The scale B = {0, 3, 6, 9, 12} is a 3-generated
well-formed scale between A and Ac . The associated word RL3 RL does not end with R. The ﬁrst
column of the matrix U is not equal to the second column of V.
Generalized diatonic scales D ⊂ ZN for N = 12, . . . , 24 are presented in the Table 1. The
scale generators m are listed in the third column and the cardinalities |D| are listed in the last
column, accordingly.
Table 2 shows the same data for quarter-tone (N = 24) to sixth-tone systems (N = 36).
As already mentioned in connection with the exceptional case N = 15, the existence of nontrivial generalized diatonic scales is not guaranteed for odd cardinalities N . However, on the basis
of computer experiments we formulate the following conjecture.

CONJECTURE 3.15 In each N -chromatic universe ZN , N ≥ 12, N = 15, there is exactly one generalized diatonic scale. In other words, every natural number N ≥ 12, N = 15 is the denominator
of a chromatic number m/N with m > 2.
There is another interesting structural aspect of the traditional diatonic scale, which has also been
investigated in the context generalizing it. In the 12-tone chromatic the diatonic scale contains a
tritone, which embodies an ambiguity between augmented fourth and diminished ﬁfth. The tritone
as a two-tone set is invariant under the tritone transposition T6 and is therefore an instance of a
limited transposition set in Z12 . Limited transposition sets play an important role in the music
theory of the 12-tone system, including the study of scales. Olivier Messiaen dedicated widely
recognized investigations into limited transposition sets after he explored them compositionally
in his Preludes for piano of 1929. In tonal harmony it is well known that the diminished seventh
chord links different major and major keys and offers certain means for modulation. This chord
contains two tritones and is a limited transposition set. However, the smallest limited transposition
set is the tritone, which is a subset of the diatonic scale.6 Enharmonic modulations emphasize the
ambiguity of the tritone.
In the N-chromatic universe, it is therefore interesting to see whether or not the generalized
diatonic scale has a limited transposition subset. The concept of the hyperdiatonic scale as introduced by Clough and Douthett [2] after the works of Agmon [1] involves the tritone as a central
constituent. Therefore, we propose the following generalization of this concept.

DEFINITION 3.16 A generalized diatonic scale A ⊂ ZN is a hyperdiatonic scale if it contains
a (non-trivial) limited transposition subset L ⊂ ZN of smallest possible cardinality in the
N-chromatic universe.
r
r
If N = p11 · · · ps s is the prime power decomposition of N with prime numbers p1 < p2 < · · · <
ps , the limited transposition subsets of smallest possible cardinality in the N -chromatic universe
are exactly the translates of the set (N/p1 )ZN . Whenever N = p1 is prime, the generalized diatonic scale is not a hyperdiatonic scale in the sense of Deﬁnition 3.16, because the only limited
transposition set is the entire chromatic system ZN = {0, 1, . . . , N − 1}. There are also chromatic
cardinalities N, which are not prime numbers, whose generalized diatonic scales are not hyperdiatonic. For N = 21, the generalized diatonic scale {0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17, 19} is
a diatonic scale of generator 8 without any limited transposition set.
Deﬁnition 3.16 does not postulate uniqueness of the limited transposition subset, such that
hyperdiatonic scales may also contain certain larger limited transposition subsets. For N = 14,
the generalized diatonic scale {0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12} is 3-diatonic and contains the limited
transposition set {0, 3, 7, 10}, which includes the smallest limited transposition set {0, 7}.

4. Wyschnegradsky’s diatonicized chromaticism
The ﬁnal section of this article is dedicated to a historically interesting instance of a hyperdiatonic
scale. In the Preface of his Preludes, opus 22, composed in 1916, Ivan Wyschnegradsky7 [25]
deﬁned what is meant by a diatonic scale in the quarter-tone system (see Figure 3). He wrote:
Structurally the work is based on a non-symmetrical scale comprising 13 tones, which is similar to the traditional
diatonic scale. The latter comprises two tetrachords separated by two intervallic units (i.e. two semitones). In the
same way, the 13-tone scale consists of two heptachords (same structure as in the tetrachord), also separated by two
interval units. But since this unit in this case is the quarter-tone, the distance between the two heptachords will be
that of a semitone.

He compares the two scales and discusses ‘the analogy between the relationship of the 7-tone
diatonic scale to the whole-tone system on one hand, and the relationship of the 13-tone scale to
the chromatic scale on the other hand’. He continues:
Another analogy must be mentioned. That is the capacity of both scales to be expressed in terms of a circle of
fourths or ﬁfths. In the old scale we have six perfect fourths or perfect ﬁfths embracing half of the complete circle
of 12 fourths or 12 ﬁfths. In the new scale, we have 12 major fourths or 12 minor ﬁfths, also embracing half of the
complete circle, not of 12 but of 24 major fourths or 24 minor ﬁfths. It is important to bear in mind that both of
these intervals, the major fourth (11 quarter-tones = perfect fourth plus one quarter-tone) and the minor ﬁfth (13
quarter-tones = perfect ﬁfth minus one quarter-tone), which are the structural basis of the 13-tone diatonicism, are
not mere accidental results of an unequal division of the octave, but natural intervals. Their frequency ratio is: for the
major fourth 11/8, for the minor ﬁfth 16/11. Notice that the number 11, absent in all the tonal relationship known
in music up to now, is present in both intervals, as well as in some other quarter-tone intervals.

The 13-tone scale can be transposed on each of the 24 degrees of the quarter-tone scale. The
ﬁrst transposition is called ‘Position Do’.
Each prelude of opus 22 is written in a different position. The ﬁrst prelude uses position C,
and the third prelude uses position B (Figure 4). Note that this scale cannot be transposed in the
12-tone system.

Wyschnegradsky’s diatonicized chromatic scale is an instance of a hyperdiatonic scale. In particular it belongs to the family of generalized diatonic scales in the N -tone chromatic universes for
N divisible by 4. Wyschnegrasky’s studies, which were published in 1979, but whose beginnings
date back to 1916, should be acknowledged as predecessors of the later investigations by Agmon
[1] and Clough and Douthett [2].8 We summarize some basic facts in the following theorem.
THEOREM 4.1 Let k be a non-negative integer k ≥ 2. The generalized diatonic scale in the N =
4k + 4-tone chromatic is
Wk = {0, 1, 3, 5, . . . , 2k + 1, 2k + 2, 2k + 4, . . . , 4k + 2}.
This scale has |Wk | = 2k + 3 tones (scale degrees), and is generated by m = 2k + 1. The step
pattern contains exactly two semitones of chromatic size 1 (between 0 and 1 as well as between
2k + 1 and 2k + 2). All other steps are whole steps of chromatic size 2. The three numbers N , m
and |Wk | satisfy the equation
N = m + |Wk | = 4k + 4.
The scale Wk is a hyperdiatonic scale which contains the limited transposition set {0, 2k + 2}.
Proof We reduce the ﬁrst k + 2 even and the ﬁrst k + 1 odd multiples of 2k + 1 modulo 4k + 4
and obtain:
0(2k + 1) = 0
2(2k + 1) = −2
................... ... ...........
2k(2k + 1) = 2k + 4
(2k + 2)(2k + 1) = 2k + 2

1(2k + 1) = (2k + 2) − 1
3(2k + 1) = (2k + 2) − 3
................... ... ...................
(2k + 1)(2k + 1) = 1.

This calculation shows that the 2k + 3-element 2k + 1-generated scale is exactly Wk . Close
inspection shows also that the step pattern is exactly as described in the proposition. The balance 2 × 1 + (2k + 1) × 2 = 4k + 4 yields 4k + 4 chromatic steps in total. The semitones are
maximally evenly distributed, because they are interrupted by k whole steps between 1 and 2k + 1
and k + 1 whole steps between 2k + 2 and 4k + 4 = 0. Thus Wk is a large ME ∗ -scale. It is tightly
generated because the small step 1 is also the rare step. The difference between the cardinalities
of Wk and its complement is |Wk | − |Wkc | = 2k + 3 − [4k + 4 − (2k − 3)] = 2, which cannot be

surpassed. Hence Wk is the generalized diatonic scale in Z4k+4 with the asserted properties. In
particular it is a hyperdiatonic scale.

Without proof we mention that the ratio (2k + 1)/(4k + 4) is associated with the word
RLRLk−1 R on the shufﬂed Stern–Brocot tree. The penultimate and ultimate predecessors of
(2k + 1)/(4k + 4) on the Stern–Brocot tree are k/(2k + 1) and (k + 1)/(2k + 3), respectively.
k/(2k + 1) is a convergent for (2k + 1)/(4k + 4), which implies that Wk is tightly generated.
Similarly there are two families of hyperdiatonic scales in chromatic universes with N ≡ 2
mod 4 which split in two subcases mod 8:
(1) generators m/N = (2k + 1)/(8k + 6) for hyperdiatonic scales in chromatic universes with
N ≡ 6 mod 8 are associated with the words RLLLRLk−1 R of the shufﬂed Stern–Brocot
tree, while
(2) generators m/N = (2k + 1)/(8k + 2) for hyperdiatonic scales in chromatic universes with
N ≡ 2 mod 8 are associated with the words RLLRRLk−1 R of the shufﬂed Stern–Brocot
tree.9
The family of trivial generalized diatonic scales in chromatic cardinalities with odd cardinality
N = 2k + 1 and generators m/N = 2/(2k + 1) is associated with the simple words RLk−1 R
on the shufﬂed Stern–Brocot tree. For the non-trivial generalized diatonic scales in chromatic
cardinalities with odd cardinality, i.e. for generators m > 2, much more diversity can be observed
in the associated pathways along the tree. It remains an open question whether this reﬂects a
potential musical diversity in the character of these scales.

Notes
1. The generic level of description in [4], [3] is algebraically linked to what I call cyclic tone systems as a special cases
of tuning groups (see [12] and [13]). The generic interval system controls the counting of steps and—in the case
of generated scales—of generator intervals within the generalized circle of “ﬁfths”. Well-formed scale theory—as
mentioned above—is essentially built upon a linear automorphism of the generic interval system which exchanges
the circle of steps with the generalized circle of ﬁfths. In contrast to the external deﬁnition of the generic interval
system (like a metalanguage for counting in a scale, so to say), cyclic tone systems are deﬁned as factor groups of
the free group, generated by intervals such as octave and ﬁfth. This is an intrinsic deﬁnition where the cyclic tone
system is constructed within the speciﬁc level. The group isomorphism between the generic interval system and the
cyclic tuning group provides a music-theoretically interesting connection between these levels.
2. The general theory of well-formed scales does not require the choice of an equally tempered 12-chromatic universe
from the outset. The diatonic scale is generated by a ﬁfth (e.g. with frequency ratio ω = 3/2 and spanning the linear
pitch interval g = log2 (ω) within the octave with frequency ratio 2/1 and linear pitch interval log2 (2) = 1. But any
generator “close enough” to g = log2 (ω), such as g = 7/12 yields the same structural results. The mathematical
condition for “close enough” is that the ratio 4/7 needs to be a semi-convergent of the number g.
3. Seventh chords in the generic diatonic Z7 are the white keys of such a trivial generalized diatonic scale, while
the complementary triad forms the black keys. The same observation drives Noll’s deﬁnition of a pseudo-diatonic
system [16].
4. The microtonal composer Mark Gould (see [23]) conﬁrmed in e-mail conversations that he favours this scale.
5. Recall that we restrict our considerations to the left half of the entire tree below the node 1/2.
6. The harmonic minor scale also contains two tritones.
7. According to his son Dimitri, Ivan Wyschnegradsky—who lived in Paris—wanted the transliteration of his name
written without accents. I follow his preference (see also [26]).
8. Clough and Douthett [2], pp. 168–69 dedicate particular investigations to the study of interval circles in the quartertone diatonic set M24,13 , i.e. in ‘Wyschnegradsky’s’ hyperdiatonic scale.
9. This is even true for k = 1 with the word RLLRRL−1 R = RLLRL.
