TEACHING

MUSIC

THEORY:

THE

UNIVERSITY

JANET McGAUGHEY

There seems little doubt that significant changes are taking
place today in the pedagogy of music theory at the college level.
At The University of Texas the changes in progress seem to
result from the influence of two primary sources.
First of
these is the Comprehensive
Musicianship program, initiated
by the Contemporary Music Project of the Music Educators
National Conference.
The second significant influence for
change stems from the effort being made by some scholars to
perform the challenging task of identifying, amid the complexities of advanced theoretical systems, those basic operations
which may be introduced in terms comprehensible to beginners
in the study of theory;

develops.
Although it might be assumed that these two sources
would tend to suggest contradictory kinds of change, that has
not been our experience;
rather, the second is playing an important role in helping us implement what have emerged in our
case as the most significant curricular innovations adopted as
a result of the experimental CMP program.

effort to break loose from teaching patterns which were not

failed but taught us something of value in their failure. At this
school we attempted to implement the following:
1.

Use of the "common elements approach" to survey the
widest possible spectrum of periods and styles in early
college training, reserving study in depth of limited
segments for upper division and graduate work.

2.

Derivation of materials for teaching the rudimentary
skills from very early music, from works displaying
current innovative practices and a wide variety of sound
and from non-Western
sources,

from tonal music of the major-minor system and from
folk, popular, and jazz sources.

improving quality in the entire continuum.

What has not survived in our curriculum is the practice of

attempting to provide students with professional

centuries of Western music. Undoubtedly, this works for some
classes, probably small classes with a consistently high quality
of pre-college preparation.
Certainly this kind of teaching has
its delights, especially in the discovery of unexpected relatedness between apparently dissimilar kinds of music.

It was when we realized that our situation was leading to this
kind of failure with some students that we began the process of
