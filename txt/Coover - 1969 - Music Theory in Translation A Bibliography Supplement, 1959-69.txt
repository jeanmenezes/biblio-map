importantly,

bounty of translations
trend - as well as responding to it - are two conditions worthy
of note. First, it seems clear from this survey that translations and analyses of important theoretical works are becoming increasingly appropriate projects for doctoral dissertations.
Secondly, the outlets for such studies, whether connected with a doctoral candidacy or not, multiply rapidly. Not
in general still available on microfilm
only are dissertations
or in Xerox prints at very little cost, but this journal and
several others allocate space occasionally to translations.
In
addition, four series of monographs, all fairly recently begun,
are devoted primarily to the publication of translations:
the
Yale Music Theory Translation Series (Yale University Press),
the Colorado College Music Press Translations, Musicological
Studies and Documents (American Institute of Musicology), and
Musical Theorists in Translation (Institute of Medieval Music).
Only one volume of one of those monographic series was in
print at the time the original survey was completed!
The increasing rate at which translations
are being produced
It probably means, too,
suggests some exciting prospects.
that this compiler should be less than sanguine about the exhaustiveness of the present list. He will, of course, be grateful for information about omissions
and errors as users of
the supplement run across them.
