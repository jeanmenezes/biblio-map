USE OF THE EXCLUSION RELATION
TO PROFILEPITCH-CLASS SETS

JohnClough

In the developmentof pitch-classset (pc set) theory, there is no concept more central than that of inclusion. It is the basis of Forte's setcomplex and plays an importantrole in recent investigationsby Lewin,
Morris,and Rahn.1 Takinga different (or complementary)approachto
the problemof characterizing comparing sets, I shall explore here
and
pc
the exclusion relation, which in many cases yields sharpprofilingof pc
sets and providesan alternativeperspectivefor judgingthe similarityof
pc sets of the same or differentcardinality.2
My discussionuses the following notational conventions:

of a SC.

PC Q

Pc set P is a subset of pc set Q.

P Q

For every pc set Pi in SC P, there is a pc set Qi in
SC Q such that Pi C Qi. (Note that capitalletters
may serve as names for pc sets or SCs,depending
on the context.)
The exclusion set X(A). If P r Q, I will say that P is a subclassof Q,
or, speaking loosely, that P is included in Q. (More precisely, P is abstractly included in Q.) Thus, for example, the subclassesof A = [0, 1,
3,4] are all of those SCs representedamongthe subsetsof t0, 1,3, 4 .
A SC is profiled by ennumeratingits subclasses,more particularlyso
when the multiplicity of each subclassis also specified,as formalizedby
Lewin.3
All SCs which are not subclassesof A are said to be (abstractly)excluded by A. Takencollectively, these excluded SCs form a profile of A
by negation,a kind of ground. In orderto characterize
usefully this collection of SCs, we can begin by ignoringall SCs of cardinalitygreater
than or equalto #A, for all suchSCs (except A itself) areexcluded by A,
and therefore their exclusion offers no insight to the particularity A.
of
Listed in the first two columns of Table 1 are the included SCs(or subclasses) of A (ignoring cardinalitieszero and one) and the excluded
SCs of A (ignoringcardinalities
greaterthan 3) for A = [0, 1, 3, 4].
The collection of excluded SCs, as exhibited in the middle column
of Table 1, does not yield a particularlysharpprofile of A. Suppose
now that we cull from the list of excluded SCs the following reduced
list of SCs called the "excluded*" list. If a symbol of the form "[S] *"
S
appearson the excluded* list, it represents plus all of the SCs of lower
cardinalitythan A which includeS. So if we write " [0, 5] *" on the excluded* list, that symbol represents [0, 5] plus all SCs of cardinal3
which include [0, 5]. Note that all such SCs will be on the originalexcluded list, since, for any three SCs A, B, and C, with #A > #B > #C, if
C : A and CC B, then B A. By placing [0, 5] * and [0, 6] * on the
excluded* list of [0, 1,3,4], we represent,in addition to SCs [0, 5]
and [0,6], most of the trichord SCs on the original exluded list, as
shown by comparisonof the second and third columns of Table 1. We
can think of [0, 5] * and [0, 6] * as representing
foreign strainsof SCs
with respect to A. The relatively small excluded* list is a compact descriptionof "not in A," a good "negative"of A.
Once it is generated,the excluded* list providesan efficient test for
inclusion.If A and B areSCswith #A > #B, and we wish to test whether

more membersof the excluded* list for A. If so, B[T A; if not, B C A.
For example, if A = [0, 1,3, 4] and B = [0, 1, 5], we observethat [0, 5]
B
Cr and conclude that B It A because A excludes all SCswhich include
[0, 5]. The complete structureof B is irrelevantto the question of its
inclusion in A; the inclusion of [0, 5] in B is sufficient to decide the
issue.
It may appearthat the excluded* list does not yield greaterefficiency
in simple decisions like the above. Surely we can see immediatelythat
[0, 1,5] ?T[0, 1, 3, 4]. However, it is plain that we see this precisely
because we see that [0, 1, 3,4] cannot include any SC that includes
[0, 5]. For a second example, supposeA = [0, 1,3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10] -the
octatonic scale SC, and B = [0, 2, 4, 5, 7] -the "major pentachord".
Aware that [0, 2, 4] (and all SCs including it) are foreign to the octatonic scale, we need go no furtherthan the observationthat [0, 2, 4]
I B, to decide that B [t A. Here, in essence, we invoke the fact that
[0, 2, 4] * is a memberof the excluded* list for the octatonic scale SC.
Definition and constructionof X(A).
Definition. Given a set class A, the exclusion set of A, or X-set of
Xn} having
A, symbolized X(A), is the set of SCs {Xi, X2,....,
the following properties:
(1) For all Xi in X(A), #Xi <#A.
[
(2) For any two distinct SCsin X(A), say Xi and Xj, Xi Xj.
(3) For any set class B with #B<#A, if there is some Xi in
A;
X(A) such that XiC B, then B IT otherwiseB C A.
The above three propertiesare sufficient to define X(A). Two additional propertiesfollow logically:
(4) For all Xi in X(A), Xi ?IA.
(5) For any set class B with #B < #A, if B I[ A, then there is at
least one member of X(A), say Xi, such that XiE B; on the
contrary,if B C A, then Xi[ B for all Xi in X(A).
For any particularset class A, is there more than one collection
which qualifies as X(A)? Or, perhaps,none at all? Eithercircumstance
would seriously weaken the potential usefulness of X(A). Here is the
answer.
For any SCA with #A > 3, there exists a unique X(A).
of
The aboveis provedin the appendix.In the remainder this section,
I take a less formal, more graphicapproachto the matter of constructits
ing X(A) and understanding properties.

Listed in Table 2 are the X-sets for a number of SCs in the 12-pc
universe. In order to avoid unnecessaryclutter, X-sets are displayed
without enclosingcurly bracketsand without commasbetween SCs.
The notion of the X-set may be nicely visualizedif the universeof
SCs is pictured as a lattice where each point representsa particularSC
and each line segment between two points representsan inclusion relation between two SCs of adjacentcardinality,as suggestedby Regener.4
This visualization also provides a convenient setting in which to describe the construction of the X-set for a particular It is impractical
SC.
to display here the very largelattice for the 12-pc universe.Instead,for
purposes of illustration,we shall work with a lattice for the universeof
eight pcs, as displayed in Figure 1. We can think of this universeas one
which contains eight equal-tempered"steps" per octave; there are also
other universesof eight pcs which are modelled by the lattice of Figure
1. All SC designationsin Figures1-3 are givenin condensedform, without enclosing brackets, with no separationbetween pc numbers,and
with the context "8-pc universe"understood. The lack of mirrorsymmetry around the SCs of cardinalfour is due to the fact that [0, 1, 3,
4]8 and [0, 1, 2, 5]8 are a Z-relatedpair.5
We now proceed to construct X(A) for A = [0, 1, 3, 4, 6]8. First,
ignoringall SCs of cardinalfive or greater,we dividethe remainingSCs
into two categories: those included by A (the subclasses of A) and
those excluded by A, as indicated by circles and squares,respectively,
in Figure 2. This "intermediate" of excluded SCsis relatedto [0, 1,
set
3, 4, 6]8, as the middle column of Table 1 is related to [0, 1,3, 4] in
the case examined earlier. It satisfies properties (1) and (3), but not
property (2), of the definition of an X-set. From the excluded set of
SCs, we now delete all SCswhich include SCs of lower cardinalitythan
themselvesin the excluded set. The remainingSCsare those enclosed in
thick squaresin Figure3. The readermay verify that this set of SCshas
all three propertiesspecified in the definition. It therefore constitutes
X(A), which we write as follows:
For A = [0, 1,3, 4,6]8,
X(A) = [0, 1, 2]8, [0, 1,4, 5]8, [0, 2, 4, 6]8
Note that A is a "deep scale" after Gamerin the 8-pc universe(generateableby interval class 3 or 5).6 If we compareX(A) to the X-set of
the major-scaleSC in the 12-pc universe(also a deep scale whose X-set
is given in Table 2), we find an interestingsimilarity.Both X-sets contain the chromatictriple-[0, 1, 2]8 in 8 pcs and [0, 1, 2] in 12 pcsand both contain all of the SCs(in their respectiveuniverses)that have
two (disjunct) tritones. (The interval 4 is the "tritone" in 8 pcs.) Very
SC.
loosely, X(A) is a "subset"of the X-set of the major-scale
Using a notation adaptedfrom Regener,we can describethe manner

in which X(A) represents the complete collection of SCs of lower
cardinalitythan A and excluded by A. Let the symbol SL(M,N)denote
the sublattice from M to N, that is all of the points on the lattice between M and N, including M and N. Let q and U denote the points
representingthe null set and the universalset, respectively.Finally,let
the symbol SL(M,N,c)denote the set of points on SL(M,N)of cardinality less thanc. Now for a SC A, all of the subclassesof A are represented
by SL(0,A). The remainingSCs of lower cardinalitythan A, those excluded by A, are the union of SL(X1,U, #A), SL(X2, U, #A),.....
SL(X, U,#A), where X(A)= {X1, X2,....,
Xn} as defined above.
X(A) is not necessarilythe only set of SCswhich representin this manner all of the SCs excluded by A; however it is the minimal set which
does so.
A less formalapproachto the constructionof X-setsinvolvesthe following puzzle. Suppose that for a particularSC we have reached the
situation depicted in Figure 2. We know, for all SCs of cardinalityless
than #A, whether they are included or excluded by A. Now let us
imaginethat the inclusionlattice representsan unusualcommunications
network in which a messagemay be introducedat any point whereupon
it will travel automaticallyfrom left to right over all possible paths to
the rightmostnode of the lattice. ("From left to right"here means to a
node of the next verticalrankto the right.)Wewish now to introducea
messageinto the network of Figure2 in such a way that it reachesall of
the "squared"nodes but none of the "circled"nodes. How can this be
accomplishedmost efficiently? Thatis, what is the minimalset of nodes
to which we should initially send our message?A little experimentation
will show that it is just exactly the set defined as X(A).
For SCs of cardinal less than 5 in the 12-pc universe, X-sets are
easily constructedby hand. This is also true for SCs of cardinalgreater
than 7, because of the relationshipbetween complementationand Xsets (to be treated later in this article). Unfortunately,the construction
of X-sets for SCs of cardinal5-7 is tedious in most cases, and the determination of these X-sets would ideally be accomplishedby referring
to a table. (By the time this article appears,I hope to be able to distribute a computer-generatedcomplete roster of X-sets in the 12-pc
universe.)

inclusionlattices for the universes six and sevenpcs, respectively(with

SC designationsin condensed form as in Figures 1-3). These smalluniverses provide simple illustrations of the differentiations afforded by
analysis of X-sets. In six pc (modeled, of course, by the whole-tone
scale):

It is interestingto note that the four tetrachordSCsin the seven-pc
universeall include the all-intervaltrichord [0, 1, 3]7, which therefore
does not appear anywherein the X-sets of the tetrachords.Of the remaining three trichords, each appearsexactly twice, with a different
associate, among the X-sets of the tetrachords,exhaustingall the combinations of these trichordsinto pairs. These facts are in keeping with
the idea I have argued elsewhere, that distinctions among tetrachords
(and trichords), under the diatonic equivalence relation, are quite
palpable.8
Some additionalpropertiesof X-sets.

= M5(X1), MS(X2),....,
M5(Xn) . This folXn}, X(MS(A))
lows immediatelyfrom the fact that inclusion and exclusion relations are preservedunderM5.
2. Complementation.For any SCA and its X(A), let X(A)com denote the set of complementsof all SCs in X(A). So X(A) = {X1,
X2,....,
Xn} and X(A)com = {Xl, X2 ....., Xn}. Since, for
[
two SCs M and N, if M N, then N 7M, it follows that for
any
any member of X(A)com, say Xi, At Xi. With referenceto A,
X(A)com will have the following properties,correspondingto
the propertiesof X(A):
(i) For all Xi in X(A)com, #Xi> #A.
(ii) For any two distinct SCs in X(A)com, say Xi and Xj, Xi ?
Xj.
(iii) For any SCB, with #B >#A, if thereis some Xi in X(A)com
such that BE Xi, then A? B; otherwiseAC B.
(iv) For all Xi in X(A)com, A? Xi.
(v) For any SC B, with #B> #A, if A?I B, then there is some
on
Xi in X(A)com such that BCEXi; the contrary,if AE B,
then B I Xi for all Xi in X(A)com.
192

3. Distinctness. The following is a conjecturebased in large part
on the lack of a counterexample.For any two distinct SCs A
and B with #A = #B, X(A) and X(B) are distinct. They may,
of course, intersect in one or more SCs. (In some cases, two or
more SCs of different cardinalityhave the same X-set. For exand [0,2,4,6,8,
ample, [0,2,6], [0,2,4,8], [0,2,4,6,8]
10] all have the following X-set: I[0, 1], [0, 3], [0, 51\ .)
X-sets and lattice pathways. If we walk to the right along the lattice
of the 12-pc universe,following the line segments(which signify inclusion) and arrivingat SCs of ever increasingcardinality,what can we observe about the X-sets of these SCs? As the SCs in such a chain are all
related by inclusion, it will not be surprisingif their X-sets exhibit
similarities.Tables 3A and 3B display the situations for the chains of
SCs generatedby interval class 1 and interval class 5, respectively.Because these chains are M5-related,so are the X-sets for SCsof the same
cardinalityin them.
The X-sets of each chain are arrangedin Tables 3A and 3B so that
similaritiesand differences between SCs of adjacentcardinalityin the
same chain may be readily observed. As these examples show, given
SCs A and A', with #A + 1 = #A', and AC A', the intersectionof X(A)
and X(A') is generallyextensivebetween these two X-sets, a fact which
permits simple comparisonin most cases. For example, comparingA =
the pentatonic scale SC [0, 2, 4, 7, 9] and A' = the diatonichexachord
[0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9] on the basis of their X-sets, we find that both X(A)
and X(A') include [0, 6] and [0,4, 8], whereasX(A) includes [0, 1]
(which X(A') doesn't) and X(A') includeg[0, 1,2] and [0, 1,4] (which
X(A) doesn't). Interpreted, these data indicate that all SCs with a tritone or an augmentedtriad are inimical to both A and A', whereas A
and A' are differentiatedby the fact that A excludes all SCs that have
an intervalclass 1 and, of such SCs, A' excludes only those which contain [0,1,2] or [0, 1,4].
Exclusion and pc accretion. As noted previously,given two SCs A
and B, with #A>#B, if we wish to determinewhether BE A, and X(A)
is known, it will be easier in many cases to make this determinationindirectly by invoking property no. 3 of the definition of X(A), than to
test for BEA directly. Given A=the diatonic SC [0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10]
and B = [0, 3, 6, 7], we observethat [3, 6, 7] (= [0, 1,4]) is in B and
also in X(A); therefore B? A. I suspect that this is how we (subconsciously) decide the question (a ubiquitous one in listening to tonal
music) of whether there exists a major scale from which a given set of
pitches can be extracted.
In cases where a pc set is built by accretion and at some stage be193

comes incompatiblewith a referentialSC, there is often an incremental
reduction in the degree of inclusion. By "degree of inclusion" I mean
what Lewin calls the coveringnumber, that is the numberof pc sets of
a specified SC which include a given pc set.9 Suppose that the pc set {0,
3, 6, 7, 101 is constructed note-by-note, with pc 6 or pc 7 as the last
member to be added. Underthese conditions, the enlargingset becomes
incompatiblewith the diatonic set only when the last pc is added. The
extent to which the reduction in degreeof inclusionis gradualdepends
on the order in which pcs are added. Table 4 shows two contrasting
cases within the above situation.
I suspect that, in practice,if we are given {0, 3, 6, 7, 10} all at once,
and we wish to know whether it can be extracted from some diatonic
set, the X-set of the diatonic SC (subconciously invoked) plays a role
in our judgement. (Detection of {3, 6, 71 (C [0, 1,4]) rulesout a diatonic SC parent for 10, 3, 6, 7, 10 .) I suspect that it does so also in
case 1 of Table 4, when pc 6 is added, finally forming {0, 3, 6, 7, 10}.
Howeverin case 2 of Table 4, the penultimatepc set {0, 3, 6, 101 suggests only one diatonic set, a pc set which includesalso pcs 1,5 and 9.
In this context, pc 7 will be detected immediatelyas foreignto the one
potential diatonic set (if we are attuned to this) and the X-set reference
is not necessary.
Exclusion and chord polarity. Lewin, Morris,and Rahn have proposed various metrics pertainingto similarity between and among pc
sets of the same or different cardinality. 0 Comparison X-sets offers
of
a different perspective on this matter, although it remainsto be seen
whether such comparisonis susceptibleto meaningfulquantification,as
in the work cited above. The following example servesas an illustration.
Suppose A = the diatonic SC [0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10] and B = the "octatonic heptachord" [0, 1,3, 4, 6, 7, 9],
Then X(A)= [0, 1,2], [0, ,], [, 0,4,8], [0,1,6,7], [0,2, 6,8],

[0,3,6, 9]
andX(B)= {[0,1,2], [0,2,4], [0,4,8], [0,2,7], [0,1,5]} .
Now constructing the intersection and the difference sets of X(A)
and X(B),
Let XX = X(A)nX(B) = [0, 1,2], [0, 4, 8]
OCT- MAJ= X(A)-X(B) = {[0, , 4], [0,1,6,7],
[0,2,6,8], [0,3,6, 9]}
and MAJ- OCT= X(B)-X(A) = {[0, 2, 4],
2,, 7]
[0,2,
1,5]}
Sets XX, OCT-MAJ (read "octatonic, not major")and MAJ-OCT
(read "major,not octatonic") partition X(A)UX(B) into three disjoint
subsets, providing a test for allegiance to the diatonic SC versus the

cardinalityless than seven) which are included by neither the diatonic
nor the octatonic heptachord SCs; set OCT~MAJ represents those
strains of SCs which are included at least partlyby the octatonic-heptachord SC but not by the diatonic SC; and set MAJ-OCT represents
those strainsof SCs which are included at least partly by the diatonic

tions, we acquire some sense of the polarity between the two SCs in
question.
Now suppose we are given a third SC C, and we wish to determine
whether it is more similarto A than B or vice versa.In general,if C E A
and C? B, then C is more similar to A; on the other hand if CIA and
CE B, then C is moresimilarto B. (Counterexamples be constructed
can
in the presence of unorthodox transformations.)Suppose that C = [0,
4, 7, 8, 10]. HereC? A and C? B; so a test for simple inclusionis of no
of
help. Wenow proceed to examine, then, the particularities the exclusion relations C?IA and C tB, with reference to the partitioning of
X(A)UX(B) establishedabove.
C contains one of the SCs in XX, namely [0, 4, 8]. Since XX contains only sets excluded by both A and B, the fact that C : [0, 4, 8] is
sufficient to decide its exclusion by both A and B. While it may be of
some interest, the duality of these exclusion relationships not helpful
is
in differentiating between C's relationships with A and B. Looking
further, we find that C contains exactly one of the sets in MAJ-OCT,
namely [0, 2, 4]. On this basis we recognize a particularlikeness between A and C which is not evident between B and C. Thereis a strain
of SCs representedby (and including) [0, 2, 4] which is totally excluded by B but at least partiallyincludedby A and C. However,C also
contains exactly one of the SCs in OCT-MAJ, namely [0, 1,4], and
on this basis seems "closer" to B. In summary,C seems to be balanced
and
midwaybetween A and B,with comparable
allegiances disallegiances
to both.
For a second example, suppose that A and B are defined as above
and C = [0, 1, 2, 5, 7]. Here again, C includes one of the SCs in XX,
namely [0, 1, 2]. But in contrast to the previouscase, C includes two
of the SCs in MAJ-OCT, namely [0, 1, 5] and [0, 2, 7] (twice), but
only one of the SCsin OCT-MAJ, namely [0, 1,4], and for this reason
C seems closer to A than to B.
In order to quantify these comparisons,we would need to devise
some means of dealingwith the complexities of intersectingsublattices.
In the last case presented above, for example, [0, 1, 5] and [0, 2, 7],
both members of MAJ-OCT, representsstrainswhich intersect at the
tetrachordlevel in C = [0, 1,2, 5, 7]:
197

[0, 1,5]- [0, 1,5, 7]
[0,2,7]
[0, 1,5, 7] ([0, 2,7] = [0,5, 7])
[0, 1, 5, 7]CE[0, 1,2, 5, 7].
This intersection tends to limit the number of tetrachordsin C which
are included by A but excluded by B (in addition to [0, 1,5, 7], only
[0, 2, 5, 7] falls into this category), thus weakeningthe case that C is
more similarto A than to B. There are other obstaclesto constructing
a good metric for SC comparsionbased on the exclusion relation.However, it would seem that any such metric must be logicallyequivalentto
one based on the inclusion relation. In any event, the notion of the Xset should prove to be useful as a different perspective,an additional
means of acquiringwhat Rahn calls "feel" for pc sets and their relationships.

APPENDIX
To prove the existence of X(A) for any SC A with #A>3, we constructa set
of SCsT and show that it has properties (2) and (3) on page 180.
(1),
Let FEWER = {all SCs S: #S <#A}
(A)
EXCL(A)= (all SCs S: S tA}
FEWEX
(A)= FEWER NEXCL(A).
(A)
ConstructT by the followingalgorithm:
1. Assign all S in FEWEX(A)
with #S=2 to membership T. Proceedto
in
step 2.
2. Given the initialvaluen=#A-l. Proceedto step 3.
3. If n=2, the constructionof T is now complete.
If n>2, proceedto step 4.
4. Examine each of the SCs of cardinalityn in FEWEX(A).If, for any
such SC Sj, there is no SC Si of cardinatliy in FEWEX(A)
n-1
suchthat
in
Si E Sj, assignSj to membership T. Proceedto step 5.
5. Decreasethe valueof n by one. Returnto step 3.
Wenow show that T qualifiesas X(A).
1. Since TCFEWER(A), T has property (1). [Read "T" for "X(A)" in
property(1).]
2. Choose any two SCs in FEWEX(A), and Sz with #Sa <#Sz. If SaC
Sa
Sz, then by definition of the set-classinclusion relation, there exists
some Sy with #Sy + 1 = #Sz, such that Sa SyCSz. Because of the
of
adjacentcardinalities Sy and Sz, the operationof step 4 in the constructionof T ensuresthat Sz is not assignable T. In summary,
to
SaC
Sz leads to Sz?T. It follows that SzET implies Sa[ Sz. Thus T has
property(2).
3. Since T CEXCL(A), for any SC t in T, t ?l A. Therefore,for any SC S,
t ES implies S ?[ A. This coversthe first partof property(3). Now suppose that SEFEWEX(A), which is to say S I A. By the operationof
with
step 4 in the constructionof T, if there is some S' in FEWEX(A)
#S + 1 = #S and S'E S, then S is not in T. At the next iterationof
with #S" + 1 = #S' and S" E
step 4, if there is some S" in FEWEX(A)
S', then S' is not in T, etc., etc. Since FEWEX(A) finite and contains
is
no SCs of cardinalityless than 2, the test for an includedsubclassof adjacent cardinalityeventuallyfails, and one of S, S', S", and so forth, is
assignedto T. Becauseof the transitivityof subclassinclusion,there is
some t (one of S, S', S", and so forth) in T such that t E S. In summary,
S ?[ A implies that there is some t in T such that t S. It follows that if
there is no t in T such that t E S, then S E A. Thus T has property(3).
Since T has properties(1), (2) and (3), the existence of X(A) is proved
for any A with #A>3. [The empty X(A) is not ruled out, but its occurrencewould appearto be limitedto universes 7 or fewerpc's. For
of
example,X([0, 1, 3]7) is empty.]
To prove the uniquenessof X(A), supposethat X(A) is not uniqueand that X

199

and Y are both X-sets of A, with X + Y. Since X $ Y, one or both of X and Y
must contain a SC not in the other. Say XiEX and Xi - Y. By property(4), Xi [A. Thereforeby property(5), there is a SCin Y, say Yi, suchthat YiC Xi. But Xi
EY; thereforeYi + Xi; so Yi C Xi. Likewise, (4) and (5), Yi ( A, and thereis a
by
SC in S, say Xj, such that XjE Yi. Combining two abstractinclusions,we get
the
XjE Yi C Xi. But this implies XjC Xi which contradictsproperty(2). Therefore
X(A) mustbe unique.
