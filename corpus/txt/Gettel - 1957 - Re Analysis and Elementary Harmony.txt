sensus it would be pointless in this context. Whether one progression
is "weaker" or "stronger" than another has nothing to do with how
either of them may be used metrically.
Composers certainly have not
felt constrained to use certain chords (or even certain kinds of chords)
only in weak parts of the measure, or to reserve certain others only
for accents.
The most direct way to discover that "unity between meter and
harmony" prevails in both parts of Ex. 8 is simply to perform them.
One is as clearly 4/4 as the other. Nor does the harmony prevent performance even in another meter, as shown in Ex. B, p. 245. The cathis harmony, would be awkward in other

and meter
can be examined under the heading of "harmonic rhythm"' that aspect of
the total rhythm which is marked by changes from one chord to another
and measured by the durations of chords.
Chord changes occur on
metric accents much more consistently
than anywhere else.
From the
extreme variety of progressions
involved, one would conclude that in
this connection any distinction in relative
"strength" is specious.
Rhythmically, it is the change that is effective, not the identities of the
chords. In the Bach chorale referred to previously each of the 20 metric accents is marked by a chord change. In terms of Roman numerals
and inversions
sixteen essentially different progressions
are involved.
Other examples of such regularly metric harmonic rhythm canbe found
almost at random. Preludes VII, XXI, and XXIII come readily to hand,
having been cited before.
Not all metric accents are marked by a change of chord. A chord
may begin at a bar line (with or without upbeat) and continue through
more than one measure, e.g., the first 5 measures of Bach's two part
Invention in F, the first 8 measures of the third movement in Haydn's
Symphony No. 94, and the second theme (in Eb minor) in the first
movement of Beethoven's Sonata No. 8. Melodic movement in the bass
or in the upper voices during the duration of a chord logically does not
make a harmonic progression and so does not affect harmonic rhythm.
It does of course permit metric and other accents.
Rhythms involving
repeated tones can perform the same function, also without affecting
harmonic rhythm. None of these intra-chordal rhythms is as incisive
as phrasing.
the second part of a chord divided by
Rhythmically,
phrasing can be regarded as a "new" chord, the first in the next phase
of the harmonic rhythm, e.g., meas. 2 & 6-7 in the Bach chorale already mentioned and meas. 4-5 in the Haydn excerpt just cited.
Some metric accents are not marked by a chord change due to
syncopated harmonic rhythm. Whether with or without intra-chordal
rhythm, a chord may begin in any kind of meter on a weak part of the
measure (including, possibly, the secondary accent of quadruple meters)
and continue through the next accent; or, in triple meters, the chord
may occupy the weak two-thirds of the measure. There is no necessary

and relies upon principles for determining structure by reinversion),
duction for which previous examples are hardly sufficient preparation.
The article describes
reduction as a process of removing "surface ornamentation and non-essential
movement" (p. 100). The former
is not exactly a conspicuous feature of the chorales, so in this respect
their reduction is no problem.
The same leanness,
however, often
makes it difficult to determine what movement, if any, is non-essential.
Since the lower voices frequently are shaping forces as significant as
the chorale melody, and since its rhythm often is matched almost notefor-note by the harmonic rhythm, the difficulties
cannot always be resolved on harmonic grounds.
Under these circumstances,

structural formula evenly throughout the piece, matching the phrasestructure exactly and moving more broadly but in as regularly metric
a manner as the melody generally does.
For chorales in quadruple
meter it frequently is effective to assume that a structure in half-notes
will permit as deep a probing into the essentials
of the harmoiization
as necessary.
A case in point is the setting by Bach of Du Friedefurst
used in Ex. 6. It has the added advantage of being so consistently diatonic that it can be examined with profit by elementary harmony students.
Outlining this soprano in half-note proportions (See Ex. D) yields
a closely-knit,
coherent line which audibly summarizes the formal and
tonal traits of the actual melody.
Even in purely skeletal form the
second phrase modifies and intensifies
the ending of the first.
The
third phrase is contrasting to a degree but is clearly related to the
the first two, as indicated by the layothers; and the fourth telescopes

the root position tonic chord in meas. 3, as set forth in Ex. 6, particularly since a tonic six-four was used in the comparable place in
meas. 8, which was omitted from that example. 1 In his other harmonization of this chorale Bach used the six-four in meas. 3 and found
still another setting, among several obvious possibilities,
for meas. 8.

the main thesis of the

not, but there are attendant risks which evidently do need to be pointed
