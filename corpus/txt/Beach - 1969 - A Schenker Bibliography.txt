SCHENKER'S WORKS

For the sake of clarity, I have divided Schenker's works into
the following three categories:
(1) theoretical works (see Ap(2) editions of music
pendix A for a chronological listing),
(see Appendix B), and (3) articles and reviews (see Appendix
C for a partial listing by source).
A brief discussion
of his
unpublished works (books and sketches in various stages of
completion) is also included. Finally, I have indicated which
of Schenker's publications are currently available, or will be
available in the near future, either in German or English translation.

within the framework of strict composition.
Of primary significance here is the fact that Schenker incorporates his concepts of musical structure and motion, first
stated in his Harmonielehre,
into this discussion.
Part 1 of

of this part, UTransitionto Free Composition' [Ubergainge zum

title suggests,
"Transition to Free Composition" contains the
seeds of what is to follow. For that matter, many of the ideas
presented throughout the Kontrapunkt volume appear later in
Der freie Satz in condensed forms.
Schenker's final work, Der freie Satz *8, was published in 1935
shortly after the author's death. It is divided into two partial
volumes; the musical figures are contained in the Anhang, separate from the text. Although the title might suggest a book on
compositional method, in reality it is a study of structure in
tonal music.
Schenker shows how counterpoint combines with
harmony, and other musical elements such as rhythm, to form
musical composition.
He arrived at his theory of tonal structure through detailed analysis of compositions
by the great
masters.
His method of analysis is the result of this life-long
study, and the concepts presented in this work are the final
The
synthesis of those contained in his earlier publications.
contents of Der freie Satz are divided into three main sections,
corresponding to Schenker's concept of three levels of musical
structure (foreground, middleground, and background). Starting with the background, Schenker shows how it is prolonged
by the content of the middleground, and that of the middleground
is prolonged by the content of the foreground.
Viewed in this
manner, a musical work of art can be seen as the "interacting
composite" of these levels; this is the central thesis of Schenker's conception of musical structure.
In his discussion
of the background level, Schenker presents
his discoveries of the fundamental line [Urlinie] and fundamental
structure [Ursatz]. *9 The Ursatz of a composition is its skeletal structure, which one may arrive at through a process of
reduction beginning with the foreground detail. As Jonas has
observed:

This part of the bibliography
