vocal symbols, is, I shall urge, characteristic of music. The
view I shall present, accordingly, avoids the dilemma between
theories of music which require some semantic dimension for
musical artifacts and those which insist that music is a product of an exclusively playful activity, none of whose artifacts
have, as such, a semantic dimension.
It would, I believe, be fair to say that the predominant focus
of attention in philosophies of art since Plato has been the semantic dimension of works of art. Plato or Socrates was perhaps the first to hold that the poets literally do not know what
they are doing.*l They represent gods and heroes, so the argument goes, in an all too human way. Their representations
are derived from the only available cases of things divine or
heroic, ordinary people with whom the poets have daily inter-

such representations
tations of. Accordingly,
such a representation might, even though ignoNevertheless,
rant, luckily be a true one. The result of such luck would be a
work which would so direct the attention of ordinary mortals
that they could transcend their imperfect acquaintance with
heroes and begin at least to apprehend a
less-than-heroic
higher ideal for life. Fortuitously, a work of art can directthe
human spirit in something like the way that, for Plato, reason
directs that spirit by design. But, in order for this to happen,
a philosopher - one whose spirit is already directed by reason - must select, on the basis of his knowledge of the ideal,
those representations which luckily are true, and suppress all
others.
Here we have the first glimpse of three persistent bugbears in
the philosophy of art. First, there is the view, which I shall
call the "semiotic" thesis, that works of art have meanings or
some sort of symbolic function. Second, there is the view that
in some way or another works of art are really about something extraordinary - they have a semantic dimension, but it
requires some sort of special sensibility to apprehend the true
meaning of a work. I shall call this the thesis of special meaning. Third, there is the view that I (and my colleagues, of
course), who happen to engage in that discipline which provides this sensibility (in the case of Plato, the discipline is
philosophy), am thereby enabled to evaluate accurately works
of art, while others, including even (or especially) the artist
himself, are not capable of assessing those works. This bear
I propose to call the thesis of a critical elite. In the twentieth
century the first two bears have become bones of considerable
contention. The third, on the other hand, has hardly been heard
from, at least at a theoretical level.
Richard Rudner, in an extremely important though neglected
paper titled "On Semiotic Aesthetics," argues that, since the
value of a work of art considered only as a work of art is intrinsic, and since the value of a sign or unit that has some semantic dimension or meaning, considered as a sign, is instrumental, a work of art as such could not be a sign.*2 This, by
implication, means that music as music could not signify anything, although, of course, music can be musically abused to
signify lots of things.

considerations will come together in a proposal to take the
promised new perspective on music, in which music is seen
as an iterational practice. Then, finally, I shall discuss some
of the cultural dangers of failing to adopt this new perspective
on music, focusing instead in a narrower way on the semantic
dimension of music.

1. Musical Artifacts
Whenever people do things in such a way as to involve the production of something which subsequently is a center of human
attention, we can speak of the something produced as an artifact. In some cases this way of speaking is a bit strained, as
in the case of language, where someone utters by way of, say,
giving some bit of news, a noise of some characteristic sort.
The noise uttered is subsequently a center of some sort of human attention - it can be remembered, understood, agreed with,
or the like, and it can serve as a basis for discussion, become
subject to verification, corroboration, or criticism. That noise
is called an artifact, even though it, unlike a stone axe or a
pottery shard, is not persistent enough to remain available for
human attention years after its author is gone from the scene.
Musical artifacts, like linguistic artifacts, but unlike artifacts
of many other common kinds, are of two distinct and significantly different sorts. There is the kind, usually on paper, that
is persistent enough to outlive its author, and there is that
other sort, evanescent, which is gone the moment it is completed. Only after the concert is over does the musical performance become a center of critical attention. We may recapture it only in memory, or perhaps on tape, but the result of
playing the tape persists no more than the original performance. In what follows, I shall discuss only those fleeting
artifacts, and not the persistent ones: the scores, records, and
tapes which may be viewed as artifacts that are tributaries on
the musical scene at large. Were there only scores unperformed and tapes unplayed, there would be no music to speak
of.
Though this narrows the field of our discussion considerably,
a further exclusion is needed to get squarely in view those
artifacts that we are hunting. There is a long tradition, both in
musical aesthetics and in music theory, of focusing attention
on such elements of musical artifacts as tones, intervals,

Here, we approach a juncture at which the semiotic thesis can
naturally arise. In order to view the phrase (p) above as a musical element in (a), we must expect that it will recur in compounds, such as (b) and (c), which are significantly or ("importantly") different from (a). If, however, we ride the analogy
between music and language just one step further, the semiotic
thesis is implied on the strength of considerations of (p), (a),
(b), and (c) taken above, since in linguistic analysis a unit is
not isolated as a separate linguistic element unless it can occur in significantly different compounds, where what counts as
a significant difference between compounds is a matter of a
difference in meaning. Thus, to identify the expression:
(e)

(a') It is green.
is to be much less surprised when one encounters that expression in significantly different compounds - for example:
(b') It is on the table.
(c') It is magenta.
Here, of course, these compounds are significantly different in
meaning, and the structural analogy with the cases of (p) above
might suggest that (a), (b), and (c) likewise differ in meaning.
Which, once the suggestion is accepted, involves one squarely
in some version of a semiotic thesis.

3. The Musical

Symbol

We have now to look more closely at Langer's
of spethesis

and discuss her view of the way in which musical "import" arises.
We have not, in the previous
section,

Still, it is imimport she describes

view, it
appears as an answer to a spurious question - "How does music mean?" So, with an appropriate
we
degree of reservation,
turn to Langer's
account.
The elements
of music are moving forms of sound; but in
their motion nothing is removed.
The realm in which tonal
entities
move is a realm of pure duration.
Like its elethis duration is not an actual phenomements, however,
non. It is not a period - ten minutes or a half hour, some
fraction
of a day - but is something
different
radically
from the time in which our public and practical
life proceeds.*17
The first thing we must contend with in this view is the somewhat paradoxical
notion of motion.
Musical elements,
that is,
the musically
or important
significant
parts of the heard music, are in motion, yet "nothing is removed."
Recall what you

corresponds to the figure (p). Most likely, you will agree that
it is in motion, and yet it does not move as does an automobile
down the street. There is no place that it is at at a time, and
then is no longer there. This is true for two reasons. First,
the heard sound does not have a location as does a physical
thing. Second, the heard sound does not fit in with temporal
orders that organize other things that one sees, hears, or
Let me dwell on each of these points
otherwise perceives.
briefly, in an attempt to get them more clearly in focus.
First, the heard sound does not have a location, such as, for
example, my typewriter has. I might hear it as coming from
the piano or the flute, but chances are I do not even locate it in
this way when I listen to it as music. The source of the sound
becomes irrelevant when I listen to the music. My habits of
locating sources of sound are more tied up with practical concerns that I have - I locate, in this sense, the rattle in my
car's engine because it might signal something in need of
repair. But I do not listen to music, usually, with an eye to
repairing the piano. Instead, if I am required to locate the
sound of the figure (p), I am more likelyto locate it somewhere
between high and low, but not "high" in the sense that the moon
is high, nor "low" in the sense that the valley is low. I locate
it, that is, metaphorically,
though the metaphor is old and
used as to be virtually a second literal use of
well-enough
"high" and "low."
Second, the heard sound does not fit in with temporal orders
that organize other things seen, heard, or otherwise perceived.
What is strange, for example, about saying that the andante
soda I had before the
came ten minutes after the ice-cream
concert,*18 even though it is quite literally true, by the clock,
that the interval between them was just ten minutes? What is
strange is that, in the temporal organization of the heard music of which the andante is a part, there is no relation of a
temporal sort which extends outside the heard music. Here is
another metaphor. Literally, if the concert began, as it did,
after I had the sundae, and the andante began after the concert
began, then the andante began after the sundae. But this transitivity of "after" is blocked by the boundaries of the metaphorical domain of the temporal labels I use to describe the
heard music.
These two metaphors conspire together, as do their literal
counterparts, to frame a notion of motion. Something whose

we shall have to deal with is her notion that these moving elements constitute
a very special

but our consideration

of the musical phenomenon,

up to this point go.

varicate enough to actually feel that, yes, I really do understand the music, I might nevertheless take such a position in
good faith. I have listened to the music, lived with it, to the
point where I have so much of my life invested in it that I have
become virtually one with it. The only catch is that this understanding that I feel is inarticulate, it runs beyond the words in
my language. I can pronounce, ex cathedra, an evaluation of
the music, but I find that I can never completely capture in
words the reason why I evaluate it as I do.
Thus, I become an authority. I know a lot about the music, but
there are things that I don't have the words to express. Yet, in
my thinking, there is always that one small note of intellectual
dishonesty, the one that takes a feeling of understanding that I
do not have. This is my myth, the foundation of my authority.
I might become eccentric, or get ulcers, or otherwise display
symptoms of this very slightly dishonest foundation, but
chances are I will never be cured of the myth. Since I am,
meanwhile, very knowledgeable about details of musical works,
I can maintain the public aspect of an authority, setting an example for others who, eventually, might come to feel that they
understand the music also, or else give up the quest and sink
back into the masses.
The situation, though it can be a stable
one, is quite unhealthy. Culturally it can limit the accessibility of music to people in general - why listen to it if only
those who make it their whole life can understand it?
The second level of semantic involvement is that at which the
heard music takes on the semblance of something that has a
semantic dimension, though it takes on no meaning per se. It
becomes "meaningful, but with no meaning." A Kantian view of
music (not Kant's, but very likely something Kant might have
held) might propose to understand music only at this level of
semantic involvement, excluding all the other levels as musiThis view tends very quickly to degenerate

Listening to speech in a foreign language becomes a worthless procedure in itself, and all the
more a waste of time in case there is no meaning we could apprehend if we only had the dictionary. Yet there could, according to this view, be no dictionary, since that would destroy the
