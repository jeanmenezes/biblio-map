modal theory are to be found in cosmological
speculation in Mesopotamia toward the beginning of the first
millennium B.C. *3 Modal theory then passed over, mutatis
mutandis, into music of the synagogue and of various early
Christian churches; modal theory of medieval Europe, in turn,
appears to be an importation from Byzantium. *4 Ancient Greek
elements were superimposed on medieval European modal theory, but only because medieval theorists jumped to the conclusion that medieval modes were descendants of ancient tonoi.
Amalgamation of medieval modal theory with the ancient Greek
tetrachord theory was completed in the eleventh century, largely through the efforts of Hermannus Contractius. *5 When the
church modes are given systematic presentation in a twentiethcentury dictionary or history book, the presentation is essentially that of Hermannus.
Recent Misconceptions
Since few scholars have been specialists in seventeenth-century
music theory, one should not be surprised to encounter misconceptions of the relationship between modal and key theory.
Some scholars suggest - or at least imply - that major/minor
key theory is a direct lineal decendant of the modal system;
Glarean is said to have introduced, in his DODECACHORDON
(1547), two new mode pairs which quickly dominated the other
four pairs, finally to their exclusion from the tonal system.
Frere, writing in GROVE'S DICTIONARY, says, "The ancient

207
modes gradually disappeared until only the major and minor
modes remained. *6 Lowinsky calls Aeolian and Ionian the
forerunners of major and minor. "*7 Other scholars overlook
the essential differences between modes and major/minor keys,
differences I intend to clarify in this study. Bukofzer, for example, credits Lippius, CrUger, and Carissimi with reducing
"the multiplicity of modes to only two (major and minor) ..
*8 It should be pointed out, however, that "reducing to two"
and "establishing two categories" are not the same.
Lippius,
for example (to cite one of the three whom Bukofzer names),
still maintains twelve modes, but acknowledges that they are
of two basic types according to the quality of third above the
final; Zarlino had already done this before him. The relevant
passage from Lippius reads as follows:
A legitimate [authentic] mode [as opposed to a "spurious"
one divided at the tritone] is either natural,
mode, i.e.,
when it has the major triad, or minor, when it possesses
the minor triad. There are three of each kind, according
to the species of triads - the one group comprises Ionian,
Lydian, and Mixolydian, the other Dorian, Phrygian, and
Aeolian. *9
The remainder of Lippius's discussion of the modes adheres
faithfully to the tenets and procedures of Glarean's twelvemode theory: that there are seven octave species, six of them
capable of harmonic division and six of arithmetic division,
and so on. *10
Equation of major with Ionian and minor with Aeolian is accurate in one way - they share, respectively,
the same intervalic
arrangements - but quite misleading in other ways. Dahlhaus
asserts that
In an attempt, finally, to describe the change in mode condifcept in the 16th and 17th centuries, no terminological
ferentiation is possible other than the designation of CIonian as "modus" and C-major as "Tonart. "*11
And according to Grout, with the addition of a Bb to Modes I,
II, V, and VI,

The remarks of Dahlhaus and Grout are by no means "wrong,"
but blur the essential distinction between mode and key (as
represented by major and minor scales), and suggest direct
lineal descent of major and minor scales from the modal system - a serious oversimplification
at best.

The shift from modal theory to key theory might be described
as a gradual change in constituency of the cluster of ideas

from modal theory, as will be demonstrated in this study.
Modes vs. Keys
How do modes differ from keys? This question is of central
importance to the present inquiry, and can be answered by
comparing the constituent concepts of modal theory with those
of key theory.
1. Mode has a "natural" locus; Dorian, for example, connotes
the series of pitches from D to d . Key, on the other hand,
connotes no specific set of pitches, but rather one or another
set of intervalic relationships (major or minor).
To speak of a flat situated im2. Modes can be transposed.

posed in any theoretical sense, however. Beethoven's "Eroica"
is in Eb major, not transposed C major.
3. Modes are generally paired, each authentic with its plagal.
Keys are also paired, of course, but in one or another of several ways, all quite different from authentic/plagal
pairing.
During the last several decades of the seventeenth century, C

idence somewhat earlier; relative major/minor pairing somewhat later.
4. Modes are usually conceived of as consisting of species of
fourth and fifth, keys as an ordering of whole tones and half
tones. Keys and modes (at least for some theorists) are alike
in one respect, though: they both admit optional pitches, e. g.,
a Bb in Lydian or an F# inC major.
5. Ambitus is an important aspect of mode definition and identification, but irrelevant to the concept of key.

209
6. In the church modes only one note besides the final has any
structural significance,
namely the "tenor" (dominant). Keys
gradually acquired a whole set of hierarchical associations as
harmonic theory evolved during the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries.
The first note other than the key note itself to take
on structural significance was, of course, the dominant; this
occurred already in the seventeenth century. But the dominant
of pitch keys is uniformly a fifth above the key note, whereas
the dominant of church modes varies its position with respect
to the final.

Glarean's

Modes

on firm conceptual foundation and thus make it a suitable and
useful tool for dealing with sixteenth-century
music.

insisted on the inviolability of his octave species; a Bb would
change Lydian into transposed Ionian. With the introduction of
his two new mode pairs he also made the medieval doctrine of

ordering the modes was not to give prominence to Ionian and
Aeolian as recognition of the growing importance of major and
minor in musical practice as is commonly asserted, *14 but in
order to make the finales of the mode conform to the notes of
the naturalis hexachord. *15
Though Glarean's renovated modal theory found wide acceptance among theorists and wide recognition among composers
of the seventeenth century, it had to contend with a number of

The nomenclature itself suggests that de la Croix was merely
ill informed.
Other "irregular" systems tend either toward
proliferation of modes or - in conformity with the general sevtrend - toward reduction of their numbers.
enteenth-century
Pier Francesco Valentini (ca. 1586-1653 or 1654), for example, set forth a system of 24 modes.
Using the twelve modes
of Glarean as a point of departure Valentini postulates twelve
more: an alternate Dorian with finalis D and ambitus D to d
but divided arithmetically on G; an alternate Hypodorian on D,
but divided harmonically so that its ambitus is G' to G, and so
on. 16
The tendency toward reduction of the number of modes can be
seen in such works as the early eighteenth-century
manuscript
PRINCIPES DU COMPOSITION of Nicholas Bernier (1665-1734).
17 Bernier's seven modes are situated on each of the "white
keys" and are identified as either major or minor according to
the size of third above the final. Since some of these modes
are furnished with chromatic alterations - e.g.,
the second
mode on re has a C, ascending and a Bb descending, while the
mode on si has Ft, C#, and A# - they approach the modern
notion of keys. This is all the more true of Bernier's alternate seven modes, in which major has become minor and vice
versa; the alternate seven are furnished with key signatures to
establish in effect such keys as C minor (two flats), D major
(two sharps), and so on up to B major and Bb major, both of
which possess "modern" key signatures.
Had Bernier's manuscript been prepared 50 or 100 years earlier it might be regarded as an important step toward a concept of key; since it
postdates the actual emergence of the major/minor key sysand anomalous, remtem, it must be regarded as a vestigial,
nant of modal theory.
Another way to reduce the number of modes is to abandon the
distinction between authentic and plagal.
De la Voye Mignot
(fl. mid-17th century), in his TRAITE DE MUSIQUE (1656),
having paid his respects to "Zerlain," insists that there can
be only six modes.

Eight Modes,

Twelve Modes

Of those theorists who permit both the eight- and twelve-mode
systems, Pierre Maillart (fl. early 17th century) made perhaps the strongest case for keeping the systems distinct from
one another. Inhis LES TONS OU DISCOURS, SUR LES MODES

but rather

. . . Thus when it is

a question of perfection of the ton, one pays no attention
to the perfection of the mode, nor to the [species of] octave, but only to whether the dominant note stands in relation to the final of the antiphon in accordance with the
rule of the tons. *19
The rule of the tons referred

to is the often invoked memory

214
Pri re la, se re fa, ter mi fa, quart quoque mi la,
Quintfa sol, sex fa la, sept tenet ut sol, oct tenet ut fa. *20
By keeping this verse in mind one can determine the ton of an
antiphon; he need only observe the intervalic relationship between dominant and final. An antiphon whose dominant is la,
and whose final is re, belongs to tonus PRImus. Since a "mode"
is determined by species of fourth, fifth, and octave, it is not
at all unlikely that ton and mode might be at variance in a given
chant. Maillart adduces examples of such chants. *21
Antoine Parran (1582-1650) likewise distinguishes
the eight
church modes from the twelve modes "of the Ancients" in his
TRAITI DE LA MUSIQUE THIORIQUE ET PRATIQUE (Paris,
1636). While Parran's treatment of church modes is conventional, his treatment of the twelve modes reflects the quandary
confronting many theorists of his time: how to coordinate the
twelve modes of Glarean with the modes of antiquity. Parran
is thus equivocal about naming and numbering the twelve modes;
the C mode might be either "le premier mode Dorique" or it
might be the eleventh, Ionian, mode. In his examples of cadences he uses both sets of numbers and names.
Pierre-BenOit de Jumilhac (1611-1682) deals withboth systems,
the eight church modes and the twelve modes of polyphonic
music, in his LA SCIENCE ET PRATIQUE DU PLAIN-CHANT
(Paris, 1673). His discussion of modal theory is one of the
more exhaustive among seventeenth-century
theory books and
served as the principal source on this subject for Sebastien de
Brossard's (1655-1730) DICTIONNAIRE DE MUSIQUE (Paris,
various mode cate1703). Jumilhac thoroughly investigates
naturels, transposez; simples, miximpairs;
gories-pairs,
tes, excedans, superflus; etc. -22 - and various points of view
concerning the number of modes: the several possibilities
mentioned above together with a system of 210 modes (15 different octaves each set forth in 14 ways). Jumilhac also takes
up the eight "pitch-key" modes, as well as the trend toward
reduction to two modes. (A discussion of "pitch-key" modes is
given below.)

more and more sharps and flats. Theorists generally regarded
as they had the one- and two-flat signatures
these signatures,
of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, as symptoms of transposition. Although these new key signatures betray a tendency
toward recognition of keys, modal rather than key theory is
the subject of discussion as long as there is talk of transposition. Key signatures, in fact, offer a clue to genuine "key"
(as opposed to "mode") thinking. So long as C minor, for example, is given a signature of two flats, we can be sure that it
was thought of as transposed Dorian. When given a signature
of three flats, the relative major/minor system is likely to be
assumed.
Theorists of the seventeenth century typically advocated transposition by intervals other than the traditional perfect fourth
and minor seventh up (with signatures of one and two flats,
Cerreto (1601), as has already been noted,
respectively).
in addition to a perfect fourth up, a

required
no more than two sharps or flats, later theorists adduced transpositions involving, ultimately, seven flats and seven sharps.
This ultimate step was taken by Alexander Frere (fl. early
18th century) in his LES TRANSPOSITIONS DE MUSIQUE R~DUITES AU NATUREL, PAR LE SECOURS DE LA MODULATION (Paris, 1706). That Frere is indeed dealing with transposition of modes is borne out by the fact that his signatures
for minor have either one flat too few or one sharp too many and, of course, by the fact that his book is entitled LES TRANSPOSITIONS.

(hence his signatures):
We likewise regard the minor modulation on re as the most
natural of all the other minor modulations, which in turn
we call "transposed," and it is to the minor modulation on
re that we relate all the rest. ':23
(Just a year later the connection between transposition and key
signature was to be severed by Saint-Lambert; see below.)
Theorists on into the eighteenth century continued to perpetuate
the notion of mode transposition and thus forestall, at least for
their own readers, the emergence of key theory. In spite of
Frere, these transpositions are often limited by signatures of
no more than four sharps or flats: witness Johann Joseph Fux

"Pitch-key"

Modes

I have coined the expression "'pitch-key' modes" to refer to
those systems in which the eight church modes are presented
from the start as transpositions from their "natural" loci, several with their own key signatures.
Mode II, for example, is
usually set forth in this system with a G final and a signature
of one flat; it can then be transposed - even back to its natural
locus. Though universal agreement concerning pitch-key modes
is lacking, a system such as that of Johann Jacob Prinner (1624In a manuscript treatise en1694) can be considered typical.
titled MUSICALISCHER SCHLISSL (1677) Prinner sets forth
the modes given in Example 1. ':25
A
These "modes" depart from one basic aspect of modality.
genuine mode associates a certain fixed intervalic structureand only that one - with a specific focal pitch (final); if the focal
pitch is removed by transposition, accidentals must be supplied
to make the new pitch series conform to the intervalic structure. Thus it can be said that Prinner's modes approach the
concept of key.
The pitch-key modes appear to be a strictly seventeenth-century phenomenon; there is no mention of them in the works of
L'ORGANO SUONGlarean, Zarlino, or Salinas, for example.
ARINO (1605) of Adriano Banchieri (1567-1637) may be the first
treatise to present eight modes in the guise of pitch-keys.
Prinner followed Banchieri in several important respects (e. g.,

of these modes is discussed.
(See below)
Treatment of pitch-key modes similar to that of Prinner can
be found in such other treatises as LA REGOLA DEL CONTRAPONTO (Milan, 1622) of Camillo Angleria, TRAITE DE L'ACCORD DE L'ESPINETTE (Paris, 1650) of Jean Denis, TRAITE

their number to two. The credit for reduction to two apparently
belongs to Giovanni Coperario and Thomas Campion (both are
named since the question of priority cannot be conclusively
settled), whose modal theories seem to have evolved independFrom the second decade of the
ently of continental theorists.
seventeenth century on, then, English theorists almost without
exception deal with two modes, usually to the exclusion of the
church mode system.
Meanwhile, on the continent, two-mode
theory did gradually take hold, most likely as a logical conrather than as a
sequence of Zarlino's two-fold classification
borrowing from Campion and Coperario.
If eight or twelve modes are to be reduced to two, the question
arises: which two? During the seventeenth century there were
three different answers to that question.
1.
2.
3.

Two modes, equivalent to our major and minor, paired
around a single final or key note.
Two modes: C major and D Dorian.
Two modes: C major and A minor, our modern "relatives."

The first option, parallel major and minor paired together,
seems once again to be a peculiarly
English phenomenon.
Christopher Simpson, in A COMPENDIUM OF PRACTICAL
MUSIC of 1667, says
I will show you this flat and sharp 3rd applied to the key in
all the usualplaces of an octave, to which may be referred
such as are less usual, for however the key is placed, it
must always have its 5th divided according to one of these
two ways, and consequently must be either a flat or a sharp
key [i.e., either a minor or a major key]. *36
Simpson then proceeds to give examples of, in our terminology,
the tonic triads of the major and minor keys of G, A, Bb, C,
D, E, and F.
The second option, C major paired with D Dorian, seems to
be a French phenomenon. :37 One can encounter this pairing
in such works as Jean Rousseau's METHODE CLAIRE, CERTAINE ET FACILE POUR APPRENDRE A CHANTER LA MUSIQUE (1678), L'Affilard's PRINCIPES TRES-FACILES POUR
BIEN APPRENDRE LA MUSIQUE (1694), and Loulie's ELEMENTS OU PRINCIPES DE MUSIQUE (1696). Even Rameau
adhered to this pairing in his TRAITE DE L'HARMONIE*38
of 1722, though in the "Supplement" to the TRAITE '-39 and in
his subsequent theoretical treatises he embraced the modern
concept of relative major/minor.

226
As to that modern concept of relative major/minor,
by which
I mean in effect the method of pairing which won out in the end
- it appears for the first time, as nearly as can be determined,
in Thomas Salmon's (1648-1706) A PROPOSAL TO PERFORM
MUSICK IN PERFECT AND MATHEMATICAL PROPORTIONS
(London, 1688), thus once again an English affair.
Salmon's reason for pairing C major with A minor (for example) was to permit the viol player to play in those two keys
To play in C major and then in
without changing fingerboards.
D minor would require an exchange of fingerboards.
(Salmon's
tuning advocated just intonation - hardly a revolutionary proposal. ) The outcome of Salmon's proposal was a table of proportions for major and minor pairs through three sharps and
three flats.
Later seventeenth- and early eighteenth-century
English theorists - Lord North, for example - followed Salmon's lead.
Though it cannot be proved at this time, it is likely that Salmon's concept of relatives has been passed down in Englishspeaking countries in unbroken tradition to the present.
Key Theory
Before key theory could evolve it was necessary that the concepts of focal pitch and intervalic structure be viewed as independent of one another, and before this could come to pass it
that there be a vocabulary available to make
was necessary
the distinction between the two. Words such as mode, tone,
Dorian, and so on, connote focal pitch and intervalic structure.
Even the word "finalis" cannot be understood apart from an
associated intervalic structure.
The English appear to have introduced a concept of key - "key"
understood as denoting focal pitch without necessarily connoting
This is implicit in Simpson's remarks
intervalic structure.
(quoted above) as well as in Morley's admonition: when Philomathes asks if there is anything else wrong with his exercise,
the master replies,
"Yes, for you have in closing gone out of
your key, which is one of the grossest faults which may be
committed. "*40 For Campion, a key "guides and ends the
whole song. "41
Saint-Lambert (fl. early 18th century) was probably the first
continental theorist to recognize the independence of focal pitch
and intervalic structure and, at the same time, to set forth a
system of relative major and minor keys. In his NOUVEAU

227
TRAIT1 DE L'ACCOMPAGNEMENT DU CLAVECIN, DE L'ORGUE, ET DES AUTRES INSTRUMENTS (Paris, 1707) SaintLambert makes a clear distinction between "ton" (key or keynote) and "mode" (as in major or minor). Our word "tonic" in
its musical sense may very well go back to Saint-Lambert; the
ton of a piece is indicated by the last note of the bass:
This final is always the fundamental note of the air, and
is so to speak the note tonique. ''42
"Mode, " on the other hand, is the disposition
pitches in relation to the tonic:
Mode is the determination

system upon which a piece of

Though there are 21 tons in name, there can actually be only
12 tons, according to Saint-Lambert,
upon which there can
exist either the major or the minor mode. Saint-Lambert then
proceeds to set up a table of tons with their key signatures.
*44 Thus the minor mode on G (to cite one example) bears a
key signature of two flats and is paired (as it had been with
for Saint-Lambert, is
Salmon) with B6 major. Transposition,
a practical operation which changes the ton but not the mode.
Thus to transpose an air is nothing else but to remove it
from its ton in order to place it on another, without, however, changing its mode. *45
While it is possible that Saint-Lambert came upon the notion
of relative major/minor
there is some

Saint-Lambert proposed an identical notational reform in his LES PRINCIPES DU CLAVECIN (Paris,
1702) - hardly conclusive proof of Saint-Lambert's acquaintance
with Salmon's work, but merely suggestive.

tone system rather than of modes. See, for example, Claude Palisca's article
on Bartolome Ramos de Pareja in MGG X, col. 1911. Other means of accounting for accidentals consisted of adding tetrachords to the basic medievalgamut
(Erasmus of HSritz) or starting Guidonian hexachords off on notes other than
the traditional ones (Fernand Estevan).

Hellmut Federhofer, "Eine Musiklehre von Johann Jacob Prinner, " in FESTSCHRIFT ALFRED OREL ZUM 70. GEBURTSTAG (Vienna: Rohrer, 1960), p.
49. Mode VI lacks a signature in Federhofer's example, but by analogy with
Mode II it should doubtlessly have one.

Rameau takes issue with Frere (LES TRANSPOSI"Supplement," p.llf.
TIONS DE MUSIQUE), whose key signatures for the minor mode all entail either
one sharp too many or one flat too few. Rameau's table (pp. 12-13) sets forth
major keys and their minor relatives, together with the "modern" key signatures.

Norman Phelps, writing in Willi Apel's HARVARD DICTIONARY OF MUSIC,
2nd ed. (Cambridge: Harvard, 1969), p. 847, apparently overlooked Salmon's
and Saint-Lambert's treatises when he credited Alexander Malcolm with introducing modern signatures for the first time in A TREATISE OF MUSICK,
SPECULATIVE, PRACTICAL, AND HISTORICAL (Edinburgh, 1721).
