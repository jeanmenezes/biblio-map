*To invert, each cp is subtracted from (n-l-r), where n represents the cardinality of the cseg
and r is the number of times a particular cp is repeated. In this instance, r=2, since cp 1 is
repeated once and cp 3 is repeated once.

Figure 14

247

The csegclass name of a repeated-note cseg is a hyphenated composite
label, based on the cseg's similarity to nonrepeated-note csegclasses. The
cardinality of the cseg appears to the left of the hyphen. To the right of the
hyphen, separated by slashes, are the ordinal numbers of two related csegclasses. The first ordinal number represents the csegclass label of some cseg
whose COM-matrix is identical to that of the repeated-tone cseg except that
it contains a plus in the place of each 0 in the upper right-hand triangle.
The second ordinal number represents the cseg which contains a minus in
each of those positions. In Figure 15A, csegclasses c5-2 and c5-4 differ
from the repeated note cseg in only one position each; the composite label
is rc5-2/4 ("rc"stands for "repeated-note csegclass").32Two repeated notes
will result in two zeros in the upper right-handtriangle, as shown in Figure
15B, and so on. The CSIM function will return the same value when measured between a repeated-note cseg and the csegclasses represented in its
composite label (or between those two csegclasses), since each of these
csegclasses differs precisely in the positions of the COM-mtarix where a
"0" appears for the repeated-note set. Therefore, the name of the repeatednote cseg allows us to generate the COM-matrix of the repeated-note cseg
(and therefore the normal form of the cseg itself) merely by comparing the
csegclasses in its name. Finally, our similarity and embedding functions33
still hold for repeated-note csegs, as for nonrepeated-note csegs.
Analytical Applications. We have chosen to illustrate some analytical
applications of the preceding contour theories in the first of Anton Webern's
Funf Stucke far Orchester, Opus 10. The movement divides into four twoand four-bar phrases-A (mm. 1-2), B (mm. 3-6), C (mm. 7-10), and D
(mm. 10-11)-plus a concluding 1-bar"codetta"of a single reiteratedpitch.
The two central phrases are joined in an antecedent-consequent relationship. Both consist of a broad solo line played in the upper register over a
sustained celesta trill. Both melodies have substantial accompaniments: a
series of chords beneath the antecedent phrase, and a thicker, more contrapuntal accompaniment to the consequent. Flanking this central portion on
either side are opening and closing sections of sparser texture, consisting
of solo lines without accompaniment. The first and last bars of the movement feature striking instances of Klangfarbenmelodie, while the second
and penultimate bars consist of unaccompanied solo lines on distinctive,
coloristic instruments. Thus the opening and closing sections frame the
central portion in a symmetrical arrangement, as shown in Figure 16.
Each of the four principal melodies forms a melodic contour of cardinality six. Yet in each case the six cps are partitioned differently in terms of
rhythm, register, and/or timbre: the first as 3 I 3, the second as 4 I 2, and
the third as 5 I 1. The final melody is interruptedby rests and has no change
in instrumentation; thus it forms a 6 I 0 partition. Comparison of set-class
membership reveals that no pair of melodies belongs to the same set class.

GLOSSARY
COM-matrix (comparison matrix) - a two-dimensionalarraythatdisplaysthe
resultsof the comparisonfunction, COM(a,b) for any two c-pitches in c-space.
If b is higherthana, the functionreturns"+"; if b is the same as a, the function
returns"0"; and if b is lower than a, COM(a,b) returns"-."
C-pitches (cps) - elements in c-space, numberedin order from low to high,
beginning with 0 up to (n - 1), where n equals the number of elements.
C-segment (cseg) - an ordered set of c-pitches in c-space.
C-space (contour space) - a type of musical space consisting of elements arranged from low to high disregardingthe exact intervalsbetween elements.
C-space segment class (csegclass) - an equivalenceclass made up of all csegs
relatedby identity,translation,retrograde,inversion, and retrograde-inversion.
C-subsegment (csubseg) - any orderedsubgroupingof a given cseg. May be
comprised of either contiguous or non-contiguousc-pitches from the original
cseg.
INTn - any of the diagonals to the right of the main diagonal (upper left-hand
to lower right-hand
corer) of the COM-matrix,in which n standsfor the difference between order position numbers of the two cps compared; that is, INT3
compares cps which are 3 positions apart.
Inversion - the inversionof a cseg S comprised of n distinct cps is writtenIS,
and may be found by subtractingeach c-pitch from (n - 1).
Normal form - an ordered arrayin which elements in a cseg of n distinct cpitches are numberedfrom 0 to (n - 1) and listed in temporal order.
Prime form - a representativeform for identificationof cseg classes, derived
by the following algorithm:(1) if necessary,translatethe cseg so its contentconsists of integers from 0 to (n - 1); (2) if (n - 1) minus the last c-pitch is less
than the first c-pitch invert the cseg; (3) if the last c-pitch is less than the first
c-pitch, retrogradethe cseg. Appendix One lists the csegclasses and their correspondinglabels as used in this paper.The first numberof the label represents
the cardinalityof the csegclass and the second numberrepresentsits ordinalposition on the list: thus c5-12 representsthe twelfthcontouron the list of five-note
csegclasses.
Translation - an operationthroughwhich a csubseg is renumberedfrom 0 for
the lowest c-pitch to (n - 1) for the highest.

SIMILARITYMEASUREMENTS:
ACMEMB(A,B) - counts the total number of mutually-embeddedcsegs of
cardinality2 through the cardinalityof the smaller cseg and adjusts this to a
decimal value by dividing by the total numberof possible subsegs of A and B
(excluding the null set for each and the one-note csubsegs).
CEMB(A,B) - counts the numberof times cseg A is embeddedin cseg B, then
divides this sum by the total numberof csubsegs of the same cardinalityas A
possible, to returna value that approaches 1 for csegs of greater similarity.
CMEMBn(X,A,B) - counts the number of times the csegs, X (of cardinality
n), are mutuallyembeddedin both csegs A and B. (The variable"X" may successively representmore than one cseg-type duringthe course of the function.)
Each cseg X must be embeddedat least once in both A andB; then, all instances
of X are countedin both A and B. The total numberof mutually-embedded
csegs
of cardinalityn is then divided by the numberof n-cardinalitycsubsegs possible
in order to returna decimal numberapproaching1 as csegs A and B are more
similar.
CSIM(A,B) - measuresthe degree of similaritybetween two csegs of the same
cardinalityby comparingspecific positions in the upper right-handtriangle of
the COM-matrixfor cseg A with the correspondingpositions in the matrix of
cseg B in order to total the number of similarities between them. This sum is
divided by the total numberof positions comparedto returna decimal number
that signifies greater similarity between csegs as the value approaches 1.
In addition, ACMEMB(A,B), CEMBA(A,B), CMEMBn(X,A,B), and
CSIM(A,B), generalize each of the functions above to measure similarity between csegclasses.

APPENDIX
C-SPACE SEGMENT-CLASSES
OF CARDINALITIES 2 THROUGH 6
The following table of csegclasses, cardinalities2 through6, is a portion of
the outputof a computerprogramwrittenin March 1986. The program,written
in standardPascal language, was implementedon a Digital PRO-350 using the
Xenix Pascal compiler and editor.
The csegclasses are listed in prime form, groupedby cardinality,and numbered in ascending order by prime form considered as an integer value. An
asterisk (*) following the csegclass name indicates identity under retrograde
inversion. For referentialpurposes, the INT1of a csegclass is listed at the right
of its csegclass representative.

NOTES
1. A bidimensional model for pitch, distinguishingpitch (or pitch height) from pitch
class (called pitch quality or chroma) has existed in the psychologicalliteraturesince
the mid-nineteenthcentury. Christian Ruckmick ("A New Classification of Tonal
Qualities,"Psychological Review36 [1929]: 172), for example, cites an M. W. Drobisch article from 1846 ("Uber die mathematischeBestimmungder musikalischen")
as the earliest attemptto depict pitch perceptionas a helical model. This model shows
the close perceptualproximity of octaves as distinct from rising pitch height by the
vertical alignment of octave-relatedpitches within each turn of the helix.
models for pitch
2. In recent years, several psychologists have posited representational
perceptionon the basis of experimentation,among them Diana Deutsch, Carol Krummodel for pitch is a double

helix wrappedaround a helical cylinder, where ascent representspitch height with
octave-relatedchroma aligned vertically while a downwardprojection of each pitch
producesa circle of fifths model. Further,a vertical plane passing throughthe double
helix model divides those tones which are diatonic to a given key from those which
are not. See Shepard's "StructuralRepresentationsof Musical Pitch," in Diana
Deutsch, ed., The Psychology of Music (NY: Academic Press, 1982), pp. 343-390,
models for pitch perception. Shepardnotes elsefor an overview of representational
where, however, that certain aspects of pitch perception differ markedly among
listenersdependingupon their musical backgrounds.In experimentsundertaken
jointly with Krumhansl in 1979, Shepard discovered that musical listeners perceived
octave-related
pitches as functionallyequivalent, whereas subjects with less musical
experience did not perceive such an equivalence. See his "IndividualDifferences in
the Perceptionof Musical Pitch," in DocumentaryReport of the Ann Arbor Symposium (Reston, VA: Music Educators National Conference, 1981), pp. 152-174, for
further details of this phenomenon. For purposes of this article, we will therefore
assume experienced musical listeners in discussions relating to perceptualissues.

5. W. J. Dowling and D. S. Fugitaniin the firstof two experimentsdescribedin "Contour,
Interval, and Pitch Recognitionin Memory for Melodies" (Journalof the Acoustical
Society of America49 [1971]:524-431) discoveredthat listenerswere likely to confuse

263

the exact transpositionof a novel non-tonalmelody with a second non-tonalmelody
if the latterretainedthe same contour.Thus, they concluded that listenersretainnontonal melodies in memory solely in terms of contour.The authorsadmitted,however,
that their subjects' confusion of same-contourmelodies with transpositionsof the
originalmelody may haveresultedfrom the severeconstraintsplaced on the intervallic
constructionof the melodies used in this experiment.Only minor seconds, majorseconds, and minor thirds were used (pp. 527-528). See also Dowling, "MentalStructures," p. 146.
6. James C. Bartlettand W. Jay Dowling in "Recognitionof TransposedMelodies: A
Key-Distance Effect in Developmental Perspective"(Journal of ExperimentalPsychology: HumanPerceptionand Performance6 [1980]: 501) give a brief overview of
several experiments,concluding that "in all of these tasks with unfamiliarmelodies,
subjects seem to have little trouble reproducingor recognizing the melodic contour,
but they have a great deal of trouble with the exact-pitchintervalsamong the notes."
Musical Structureand
Judy Edworthy,in "Melodic Contourand Musical Structure,"
Cognition (London: Academic Press, Inc., 1985), confirms these findings. Her experiments involve transpositionof novel, tonal melodies to various keys. She concludes that "intervalinformationis well-definedand precise only when the listener is
able to establish a key. . . . Contour informationis immediatelyprecise but decays
rapidlyas a melody progressesand its length increases. However,accurateencoding
of contourdoes not dependon the listener'sability to establisha key" (p. 186). In nontonal contexts, subjectsshouldthereforebe able to recognizerelationshipsamong contours more quickly and easily than among pitch-class sets, since only the latter
requiressubjects to perceive intervallicinformation.
7. Robert Morris, in his Compositionwith Pitch Classes: A Theory of Compositional
Design (New Haven: Yale University Press, in press), develops five such spaces.
David Lewin'sGeneralizedMusical Intervalsand Transformations
(New Haven: Yale
University Press, 1987) posits six temporaland six pitch- and/or pc-relatedmusical
spaces (pp. 16-25).
8. John Rahn, in Basic Atonal Theory (New York: Longman, 1980) clearly and consistently distinguishes between pitch relationships and pitch-class relationships,
effectively separatingtheoreticalconcepts which apply only to pitch space from those
which operate in pitch-class space.
9. In additionto RobertMorris'sCompositionwith Pitch Classes, anotherimportantre"A

work raises importantissues regardingmusical structure,analysis, and
Friedmann's
perception. His article posits a numberof theoretical constructs for comparingand
relatingmusical contours, includingthe contour adjacencyseries and relatedvector,
the contour class with its associated vector, and the contour intervalsuccession and
array.Although these formulationsdiffer from ours in a number of crucial aspects,
his work has greatly influenced our thinking.
Discussion of musical contouris not withoutearlier precedents,however,particularly in the writingsof music theorist-composers,such as Arnold Schoenberg(Fundamentals of Musical Composition[New York:St. Martin'sPress, 1967], pp. 113-115),
Ernst Toch (The ShapingForces in Music [New York:CriterionMusic Corp., 1948],
Chapter5), and RobertCogan and Pozzi Escot, whose Sonic Design: The Nature of
Soundand Music (EnglewoodCliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall,Inc., 1976)makesextensiveuse

(Cambridge:HarvardUniversity Press, 1984).
10. Morris, Glossary, under the word "c-space."
11. Morris, Definition 1.1.
12. Friedmanndefines contour intervals(CIs) as "the distance between one element in a
CC (Contour Class) and a later element as signified by the signs + or - and a
number.For example, in CC < 0-1-3-2 >, the CI of 0 to 3 is +3, and the CI of 3
to 2 is -1" (p. 246). He readily acknowledgesthat the contour intervalis "infinitely
expandableor contractablein pitch space," and that "a larger CI contains a great
numberof interveningpitches in the registralorder of the musical unit . . . [and] is
by no means necessarily a larger intervalin pitch space" (p. 230). Although we find
such a concept interesting,it seems counterintuitive
from the perspectiveof a listener's
perceptions,since a contourintervalof +3 may be considerablysmaller in pitch space
than a CI of +1. For example, the cseg < 0 1 3 2 4 > may be realized as follows:
4
C+3

CI+3

2

CI+3
/ CCI+I

0
In this case, CI + 3 (measured from contour pitches 1 to 4) is only a major third,
while CI + 1 is a minor tenth. Other musical realizationsof this cseg may produce
even largerdifferencesin CI size. Further,Friedmannuses the contourinterval, contour interval array,and associated vectors as an equivalence criterion (pp. 231 and
234), and to compare similarities among contours in his analyses (pp. 240 if). Since
we choose not to define intervals in c-space, our equivalence criteria and similarity
relations differ markedly from Friedmann'sin concept.
13. We use a slightly differentdefinition than Morris, since we refer to all contours as
c-segments, not as c-sets.
14. Note that our definitions do not account as yet for repeatedtones within a musical
contour.This is a separateissue which will be addressedat a laterpoint in the article.
15. Morris, Definition 1.2.
16. Friedmann,pp. 226-227.
17. The term INT is used to be consistent with Morris'sterminology for matrices in pand pc-space, where the integers appearingin each diagonal give informationabout
a set's intervallicstructure,including propertiesof invariance.Thus the term INT is
retainedhere, even though we do not define intervals in c-space.
18. We rephraseMorris'sDefinition 1.4 slightly to conform with our terminology:the inversion of a cseg P, of cardinalityn, is the cseg IP. Each IPm equals (n - 1) - P
where the subscript m denotes order positions with the cseg P.

19. Morris, Chapter2.
20. More formally:
Let [cp(1) . . . cp(n)] be a cseg with cps numberedin time from 1 to n.
Let "n"equal the cardinalityof the cseg;
Let "x" equal an ordinal position within the cseg, ranging from 1 to n
(thus, "cp(x)"is a particularc-pitch, located "xth"from the left).
1) If necessary, translatethe cseg to normal form,
2) If (n - 1) - cp(n) < cp(l), then invert the cseg,
3) If cp(n) < cp(1), then retrogradethe cseg.
21. The design of these functions is modelled, in part, upon the similarity measures for
by
pitch-classsets previouslyformulated David Lewin, RobertMorrisand JohnRahn.

Interval
Vector,my IntervalFunction,and Regener's
See, in particular,

SimilarityIndex for Pitch-ClassSets," Perspectivesof New Music 18 (1979/80): 445460; and Rahn's"RelatingSets," in the same volume, pp. 438-498.
22. Weare followingJohnRahn's
examplein designingfunctionsto returna decimal value
approaching"1"as similarity increases. See his "RelatingSets."
23. As previouslymentioned, the entries in the lower left-handtriangleof the COM-matrices used here simply mirror (with inverse values) those in the upper right-hand
triangle. We thereforebase our similarity measurementupon comparedpositions in
the upper triangles alone.
24. Rahn, "RelatingSets," p. 490.
25. This totalnumberof comparisonsbetweenrighttrianglesis sigma(n);which we define
as:
n-1
(s)
S =1
(in other words, the summationof an arithmeticseries from 1 to (n - 1), where n
equals the cardinalityof the cseg).
26. We choose this method of comparingcsegs of unequalcardinalityover an expansion
and generalizationof the CSIM measurementfor two reasons. First, the embedding
relationis easier to hear and thereforeis intuitivelymore satisfying. Second, any generalizationof CSIM to csegs of unequal cardinalitywould, in effect, create another
type of embedding function, since it would involve comparing matrices of unequal
size (thus embeddingone matrix within anotherand systematicallyshifting the position of the embeddedsmaller matrix to make comparisonswith each position of the
larger matrix).
27. Rahn, Basic Atonal Theory,p. 122.
28. Rahn, "RelatingSets," p. 492. Rahn generalizes David Lewin's embedding function
as formulatedin Lewin, "Forte'sIntervalVector,"pp. 194-237.
29. More formally:
c

CMEMBn(X,A,B)
ACMEMB(A,B) =

266

n= 2
2#A + 2#B - (#A + #B + 2)

where c = cardinalityof the larger of the 2 csegs,
n = cardinalityof x,
x = mutually embedded cseg, and
# stands for "cardinalityof."
The numerator this fraction loops throughthe CMEMBn(X,A,B) function succesof
sively for cardinalities2 throughthe cardinalityof the largercseg. The denominator
divides this figure by the total numberof csegs possible (2#A + 2#B) minus the onenote csubsegs (#A + #B) and minus the null set for each (2).
30. Friedmann,pp. 234-236.
31. The introductionof repeatednotes into contour theory, as formulatedto this point,
strikes at the heart of the distinctionbetween pitch space and contour space. Because
our definitionof c-space, following Morris, disregardsthe exact intervalsbetween cpitches and chooses to leave this distanceundefined,the perceptionof a repeatednote
must be seen as a pitch-space rather than a c-space phenomenon. In considering
analyticalapplicationsof contour theory, we must thereforedepart slightly from our
previousc-space definitionin order to accommodatethose segments in which pitches
are repeated.
32. In symmetrically-structured
csegs of odd cardinality (i.e., < c b r x r b c > or
< 1 3 2 0 2 3 1 >), the composite label will reflect the cseg's symmetry.For example, the COM-matrixfor the repeated-note
cseg < 1 0 2 0 1 > is shown below with
the two matrices which determine its composite label:

In cases such as these, the relatedcsegs that determinethe composite label belong to
the same c-space segment class. The composite label reflectsthis dual relationshipby
listing the csegclass's ordinal number twice.
33. The maximumpossible value for CSIM(A,B) between cseg A with repeatednotes and
cseg B without, is equal to sigma(n) r, where r is the total number of cp repetisigma (n)
tions. Such a comparison cannot thereforereturna value of "1."
34. Such a patternwill alwaysresultbetween inversionally-related
csegs in which adjacent
cps add to an odd index number,in this case, 5. Otherpatternsof invariancebetween
contours may be predicted using the TnI cycles. See Daniel
