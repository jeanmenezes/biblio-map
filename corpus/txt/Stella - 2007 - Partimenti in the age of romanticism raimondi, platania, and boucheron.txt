Partimenti in the Age of Romanticism
Raimondi, Platania, and Boucheron

Gaetano Stella

Abstract  The teaching of music composition in Italy during the nineteenth century continued to make great
use of partimenti. But during the course of the century, partimenti gradually lost their importance as guides to
improvisation, transforming instead into blueprints for a written-out practice. Prominent musicians and teachers like Pietro Raimondi, Pietro Platania, and Raimondo Boucheron tried to merge the partimento tradition with
the harmonic and formal innovations of their own era. Raimondi and Platania, significant exponents of the late
Neapolitan school of composition, searched for innovation from within their own tradition. Boucheron, in Milan,
deeply influenced by French and German theorists, used partimenti as a medium through which he could introduce
elements of Romantic harmony. The partimento lessons of all three display not only a musical sophistication that
merits our attention today, but also an insider’s perspective on issues in nineteenth-century Italian composition.

during the nineteenth century, Italian compositional theory began to
be deeply influenced by transalpine theories, perceived as more “modern” and more in accord with the ideals of the age of Romanticism. In fact,
many ­ usicians—and particularly those who were exposed to French and
m
(later) German influences—shared the idea that Italian traditional teaching
methods had become obsolete (Sanguinetti 2005, 456). Nevertheless, partimenti continued to occupy a central position in the professional training of
many Italian composers. Important musicians and theorists published new
p
­ artimento-based works that tried to cope with the problems raised in teaching composition under this new aesthetic regime.
This altered situation was also reflected in the way that partimenti were
used. In the eighteenth century, the realization of a partimento was generally
improvised at the keyboard. The written part of compositional training was
cultivated under other forms: strict and fugal counterpoint, and free composition expressed through disposizioni and solfeggi.1 Fugue had a significant role as

1  Disposizioni were exercises set in open score for two or
more voices, and involved imitation and other contrapuntal procedures. Often they were based on a partimento.
Solfeggi was a short composition, usually for voice and

unfigured bass, and was generally used in teaching as a first
attempt at free composition. Disposizioni and solfeggi are
discussed in Gjerdingen 2007 and Sanguinetti 2005.

the capstone of both the unwritten (as fuga-partimento) and the written paths
of advanced training.
During the nineteenth century, partimento teaching became more
and more a written-out practice. At the same time, counterpoint lost its status
in music pedagogy in favor of harmony, which took on the aura of a quasis
­ cientific discipline. Partimenti nevertheless remained a central tool in Italian
musical pedagogy for most of the century, and for decades Fedele Fenaroli’s
Partimenti (1814) remained the preeminent textbook in the conservatories.
New editions with added commentary were published in Italy until the first
decades of the twentieth century, even though Fenaroli’s partimenti were
grounded in an eighteenth-century concept of tonality (Rosenberg 1995, 198–​​
209; Sanguinetti, in press).
The immense fame of Fenaroli during the nineteenth century eventually
eclipsed that of all other authors, including the great Francesco Durante and
Leonardo Leo, whose partimenti had never been published. Even so, the old
custom of eighteenth-century Neapolitan masters to compose new partimenti
for their students did not entirely disappear. In the early nineteenth century,
for example, Niccolò Zingarelli, teacher of Saverio Mercadante and Vincenzo
Bellini, and a well-known opera composer in his own right, published two
books of partimenti (Zingarelli 1830). His partimenti, written in a conservative style, show hardly any traces of the harmonic novelties being introduced by the rising generation of Italian composers like Gioachino Rossini,
Gaetano Donizetti, Gaspare Spontini, and of course his own student Bellini.
Zingarelli’s conservative approach to partimenti was shared by many masters
from his era. The result was a growing distance between music pedagogy and
music practice. To remedy this situation, several musicians—from both inside
and outside the Neapolitan tradition—searched for new ways of using partimenti. Among the first of these, Pietro Raimondi and Pietro Platania tried to
adapt the old tradition to the new situation. Other musicians, like Raimondo
Boucheron—who never studied in Naples—used the partimento as a tool for
introducing to Italy the new methods of the Paris Conservatory.
Two Late Neapolitan Masters: Pietro Raimondi and Pietro Platania
Pietro Raimondi

Pietro Raimondi (1786–1853) was one of the most significant figures in the
nineteenth-century Neapolitan school of composition. He published two
important collections of partimenti: the Bassi imitati e fugati divisi in tre libri
(Imitative and Fugal Basses Divided into Three Books, ca. 1830s) and his Nuovo
genere di scientifica composizione: Andamenti di Basso numerato con una due o tre
armonie (A New Kind of Scientific Composition: Figured Basses with One, Two, or
Three Harmonizations, 1852). His best pupil, Pietro Platania (1828–1907), published his own collection of partimenti as the practical part of his Trattato
d’armonia, seguito da un corso di contrappunto (A Treatise on Harmony Followed by

Gaetano Stella

a Course in Counterpoint with Partimenti, 1883). Both men worked to preserve
Neapolitan traditions, and both wrote partimenti. But they wrote them in a
new way, differing in some respects from past tradition. Raimondi and Pla­
tania adopted an ambiguous position. On the one hand, they believed in “scientific” harmony. But on the other hand, they strove to preserve the leading
role of counterpoint.
The most unusual aspect of Raimondi’s Nuovo genere di scientifica composizione is that all the partimenti have multiple systems of figures. In fact, every
bass line is provided with two, or sometimes three, harmonizations of increasing difficulty (Example 1). Other maestros like Gaetano Greco and Saverio
Mattei had used multiple figures in the eighteenth century, but Raimondi’s
Nuovo genere is, to my knowledge, the only collection of partimenti that uses
this procedure consistently.
Raimondi’s multiple figures, however, are but a written-out manifestation of a much older pedagogic principle that lies at the very heart of all
Neapolitan teaching practice: the search for multiple solutions to the same
compositional problem. An excellent example of this practice can be found
in the counterpoint exercises completed by Vincenzo Lavigna (the teacher of
Giuseppe Verdi) under the direction of Fenaroli. In these exercises we find an
almost obsessive search for the largest possible number of alternative settings
for the same pattern, whether a cadence, a scale, or a disposizione (Sanguinetti in press). Interestingly, Raimondi—unlike most of his contemporaries—
included a significant number of partimento fugues in his collection, following a formal scheme that stretches back to Nicola Sala and Giacomo Tritto
(Stella 2006).2
This fugue tradition would be further developed by Platania in his Corso
completo di fughe e canoni di ogni genere (Complete Course of Fugue and Canons of All
Types, 1871). Platania, however, completely omits the partimento fugue and
replaces it with a new format developed by his master Raimondi: basso imitato e fugato (imitative and fugal bass). The formal scheme used by Raimondi
and Platania is outlined in Table 1. The main feature of this kind of fugue is
that, following the exposition, one avoids the key of the dominant. From a
formal point of view, the most significant harmonic degree becomes the subdominant. The formal scheme of this fugue includes two sections that do not
appear in other traditions. They were called imitazione and modulazione. Both
are sections that connect thematic statements (see Example 2). The imitazione
consists of a nonmodulating sequence that makes use of imitative entries. The
modulazione, on the contrary, is a connecting section that modulates without
2  This formal scheme, however, was not the only one
used in the Naples conservatories. In fact, Sala and Tritto
followed the school of Leonardo Leo (they were called
“Leisti”), while another school followed Francesco Durante
(the “Durantisti”). On the controversy between “Leisti” and
“Durantisti, see Rosenberg 1999.

together. If they were, the passage would be called “modulating imitation”
(imitazione modulata, Sala 1794).

Example 3 (continued)

of partimento fugue in Italian pedagogy.3 In the preface to his Bassi imitati e
fugati divisi in tre libri (ca. 1830s), Raimondi writes:
Despite the fact that the very well known Maestri dell’Armonia Choron, Marpurg, and others have only mentioned the school of the “Bassi d’imitazione” in
passing, . . . until now no one has ever published a collection of basses for the
instruction of young people who devote themselves to the musical art, in such
a way as to facilitate the path to fugue. . . . With the greatest sorrow I heard
from some ill-advised young people that in order to compose works in whatever
genre it was enough to know the principles of voice-leading and to write some
solfeggi, without wasting time in the study of fugue.

After having stressed the importance of counterpoint and fugue in the syllabus of the old Neapolitan school, he continues: “I wrote these Basses for those
who are already skilled in counterpoint. But it is necessary to warn young
scholars that they must first work hard on the partimenti by various authors,
and only after that can they attempt to compose, otherwise their efforts will be
fruitless.” He concludes with the exhortation to “live happily.”4
3  The basso imitato e fugato is still in use in the traditional
Italian syllabus of the course in composition.
4  “Sebbene i chiarissimi Maestri dell’Armonia Choron,
Marpurg, ed altri avessero accennata soltanto la scuola dei
Bassi d’imitazione, pure quest’utile insegnamento è stato

mai sempre trascurato, ne si è finora redatta una raccolta
di Bassi, per istruire i giovani che si dedicano all’arte musicale, e così rendere loro agevole la strada per passare alle

Raimondi’s preface is the only part of his book that contains written
explanations. The rest of the book contains nothing but music, following the
Neapolitan tradition of committing to paper solely the examples, and relying
on oral transmission for the explanations.
Unlike Raimondi’s partimento fugues, his bassi imitati e fugati are, from
the perspective of form, more free. There is no standard formal scheme, so the
different elements of the fugue (those outlined in Table 1) can be arranged
in different tonal and formal designs. Still, the most important difference
between the partimento fugue and the “imitative and fugal bass” lies not in the
overall design but in the technique of realization: the former was improvised
at the keyboard; the latter was written out. Compositional assignments on
Raimondi’s bassi completed by three of his students—Carmelo Fodale, Vincenzo Fiodo, and Pietro Platania—provide important evidence for the style
of nineteenth-century written realizations (Fodale 1835; Fiodo 1835; Platania
I-Nc Platania 58.3). As Raimondi wrote in the preface to his Bassi imitati e
fugati, this work was designed “to facilitate the path to fugue” (Raimondi ca.
1830s), though it is unclear exactly which kind of fugue Raimondi had in
mind. Nonetheless, it seems evident that the basso imitato e fugato was halfway
between standard partimento practice and the written vocal fugue, thus representing at the same time a final stage of partimento training and a preparatory
stage for the study of the vocal fugue.
According to Jesse Rosenberg (1995, 210), Raimondi’s choice to publish
a book entirely devoted to fugal procedures, together with the complete lack
of any explanation, is a sign of a conservative position. This is true only in part.
The late “Leista” tradition represented by Raimondi and his pupil Platania did
try to preserve the old tradition in the new era, hoping to renew music teaching from within the Neapolitan school of composition. Yet Raimondi’s belief
in harmony as science, his research into new possibilities in counterpoint, his
“contrapuntal gigantism” (Stella 2007), as well as the strong experimentalism
that surfaced in his mature compositions, all testify, despite his strong connections with an academic classicism, to the Romantic nature of his theoretical
works.
Pietro Platania

Pietro Platania, considered by Raimondi his best pupil, continued his master’s involvement with partimenti. Around 1860, when he was the dean of the
Regio collegio di musica del Buon Pastore (Good Shepherd Royal College of
Music) in Palermo, Platania jotted down a sketch for the syllabus of the har-

genere, bastava semplicemente aver conoscenza della disposizione delle parti, e far dei solfeggi, né doveasi perder

and practical sense. Written realization. After 6 months practical performance

Fenaroli, Mattei and after, according to the professor’s choice, a number of
partimenti by Cotumacci, Sala, and Raimondi” (I-Nc Platania 58.3).5 Sometime in this same period Platania wrote his Trattato d’armonia (published in
1883). Unlike his master Raimondi, Platania refused to add figures to his partimenti, thus following the age-old Neapolitan tradition. In the preface to his
Trattato d’armonia he writes:
The present treatise follows a practical system of teaching Harmony without
indications of figures in the bass line, instead instilling in the pupil an awareness of the natural and inflexible canons of Harmony, i.e. the Rule of the
Octave, the origin of the harmonized scale from the three fundamental and
immutable triads embodying the tonality, the proper tendencies of tones in
their various directions. . . . The use of figures makes pupils, notwithstanding
their professors’ theoretical explanations, one might say almost involuntarily
harmonize without a clear determination, and without analysing their own
work. I have therefore restricted the indication of figures to the end of the
book, and only to show some special or rare ways of harmonizing, different
from the common usage.6

This text, written by Platania around 1860, contains some references to an
unpublished treatise on partimento titled Sull’armonia. In this work Platania
states, “The method I hint at is based on a simple and very important rule: the
pupil must study the basses without figures, learning to recognize the right
figures after having understood the fundamental rules of harmony studied
theoretically and practically” (Platania, Sull’armonia, I-Nc S.C. 12.8.2).7
Platania follows, in general, the traditional approach used by countless
Neapolitan masters (including Fenaroli). He first begins with cadences and
then introduces the Rule of the Octave, the different bass motions, and finally
special, more complex patterns. Yet he imbues his partimenti with a Romantic
aura that is completely absent from partimenti written by masters of the previous generation (e.g., Raimondi or Zingarelli). The most original aspects of his

6  “Il presente trattato s’informa ad un sistema pratico
d’insegnamento armonico senza indicazioni di numeri sul

l’allievo malgrado le spiegazioni teoriche del maestro è

numeri sul partimento verso la fine del Corso, e ciò solo per

output are thus to be found in the more advanced partimenti, rather than in
the introductory exercises that closely follow the traditional path.
The partimento-related output of Platania may be summarized under
two main categories: real partimenti and “imitative and fugal basses.” Of the
first category of partimenti, only a single realization from Platania of one of
his own partimenti survives, together with a detailed example of a figured
partimento. No realization of an imitative and fugal bass from Platania has
come to light. Some manuscripts in the Naples conservatory library, however,
include realizations by Platania (or by his students) of partimenti by Fenaroli,
and of imitative and fugal basses by Raimondi. All these works bear witness
to significant changes that occurred within the Neapolitan tradition in the
second half of the nineteenth century.
Let us first examine a written realization of partimento no. 2 from Fenaroli’s widely published book 4. It was penned by an anonymous student who
studied under Platania around 1860 (I-Nc Platania 61). In many respects
this realization (shown in Example 4) follows past tradition. It is written in
JMT 51:1 149-3 Stella ex. 4
a keyboard style, with frequent changes in the number of voices during the
p
­ artimento—a characteristic feature of the eighteenth-century continuo practice. The realization employs, even if in a somewhat extended way, all of the

five classes of partimento rules: (1) cadences and basic axioms, (2) the Rule
of the Octave, (3) dissonances, (4) bass motions (here with remarkable chromatic variants), and (5) scale mutations (modulation). The texture, however,
tends to be more chordal than in a typical eighteenth-century partimento
realization (for a comparison with a more eighteenth-century style of realization, see the article by Sanguinetti, this issue).
An example of the second kind of partimento is no. 51 from Raimondi’s
Bassi imitati e fugati, as realized by Platania (I-Nc Platania 58.13). This realization was probably completed during the 1850s and follows closely Raimondi’s
tradition. Two excerpts of it are shown in Example 5.
The exposition begins with the subject sounding together with the bass
line, as was customary in the partimento-fugue tradition (mm. 1–8, Example
5a). Unlike in a partimento fugue, in this format the given part is always the
bass. This means that the first subject entry must be supplied by the student,
who must scan the bass line in order to find the “hidden” subject (in this case,

in bars 5–8). The identification of the subject (or subjects) is one of the chief
difficulties in the realization of an imitative and fugal bass. The second excerpt
shows a four-voice canon on a sequence (three voices at the unison, and the
remaining voice at the fourth: mm. 48–55, Example 5b). The crossing of the
voices (Example 4b, mm. 49ff.) and dissonant clash in approaching the unison (between soprano and alto, mm. 49–50, 51–52, and 53–54) are typical features of eighteenth-century counterpoint, ones that survived in the Neapolitan tradition well into the nineteenth century. The other basses of Raimondi,
also realized in Platania’s hand, are increasingly more elaborated, more and
more similar to a fugue with middle entries (on the mediant, the submediant,
or, closer to the fugue tradition of Nicola Sala, the fourth degree), imitations,
canons, and stretti.
The partimenti were also used as a means of instilling the basic principles of musical form. Thus, Platania, in some of his bassi imitati e fugati, added

slow introductions, as he also did in his free fugal compositions. The same
pedagogical function was accomplished by some partimenti that look (and
sound) like a Romantic piano etude, or a romanza. In other words, the partimento, after having left behind the eighteenth-century genres and styles of
the toccata, the concerto, or the galant sonata, made a last attempt to survive
by adopting the new trappings of Romanticism. The bass and figures in Example present a Stella ex.

Compared to the Fenaroli tradition, this partimento appears far more
harmonically advanced, with chromaticism, dissonant chords, and an idio­
matic Romantic tension. Yet a closer look reveals that the fundamentals remain
those taught by Fenaroli. In m. 1, the 5–6 exchange prevents parallel fifths
in the motion from I to II; in mm. 2 and 3, the figures are omitted because
the bass motion alone is sufficient to suggest the correct harmonies (which
basically consist of a series of successive mi-fa motions causing an alternation
between triads over the fa degrees and sixth chords over the mi degrees). The
most interesting case in this example is perhaps m. 4, where the complex
figures present nothing more than a Romantic elaboration of the cadenza composta. Thus, even if the left-hand texture closely resembles many nineteenthcentury virtuoso piano pieces (e.g., prelude op. 28/24 by Chopin, etude op.
740/8 and op. 740/12 by Carl Czerny, or op. 20/24 by Joseph Kessler), the
harmonic structure is basically the same as in Fenaroli.
The very

lines of Raimondi’s Nuovo genere di scientifica composizione, and it exhibits a strict
relationship between the figures and the melodic contour. This work, following the first part reproduced in Example 7, continues with a soggetto melodico
(melodic phrase), a period-like theme realized here by Platania with an asymmetrical period of eight plus seven bars added to the realized version only (see
Platania 1883, Partimenti bk. 3, 43). The formal design is again an A–B–A form
with a shortened ripresa, a very common feature of Italian nineteenth-century
instrumental music (Rostagno 2003, 68–70).
The Neapolitan Partimento in Milan: Raimondo Boucheron

The largely self-taught Lombard composer Raimondo Boucheron (1800–1876)
occupies a special position in the tradition of partimento.8 He was born in
Turin and took some music lessons in his childhood from obscure maestros
like Vincenzo Goletti in Cuneo and Don Amedeo Savoia and Giovan Battista
Colombo in Mondovì.9 But he managed the most important parts of his training by himself. He became a well-known composer of sacred music (from 1847
to his death he was maestro di cappella at the Milan cathedral) and a teacher
of composition. His best pupils were Edoardo Mascheroni, Edoardo Perelli,
and Gustavo Adolfo Noseda.10 Boucheron published an important book on
musical aesthetics, Filosofia della musica o estetica applicata a quest’arte (The Philosophy of Music, or Aesthetics Applied to This Art, 1842) and an interesting harmony book titled La scienza dell’armonia spiegata dai rapporti dell’arte coll’umana
natura—Trattato teorico pratico (The Science of Harmony Explained by the Relation
between Art and Human Nature—A Theoretical-Practical Treatise, [1856]), in which
he attempted the original approach of grounding harmonic procedures on
principles of psychology and ethics.
Some years later he wrote the Esercizi d’armonia in 42 partimenti numerati (Harmony Exercises with Forty-two Figured Partimenti, [1867]). With this
work, Boucheron, like Platania, tried to meld the eighteenth-century partimento tradition with nineteenth-century harmonic innovations. But unlike
P
­ latania—whose work, as mentioned, grew out of the authentic Neapolitan
tradition—Boucheron made use of only parts of the Neapolitan tradition,
using them in a different context, one deeply influenced by German and
French music theory.
8  The theoretical output of Boucheron is listed and briefly
discussed in Sanguinetti 1997
.
9  Vincenzo Goletti was organist at the cathedral of Cuneo;
Giovan Battista Colombo was maestro di cappella in Mondovì. See the anonymous manuscripts I-BGc Serassi
368GoV and I-BGc Serassi 198CGB. I found no information
about Don Amedeo Savoia.

10  Edoardo Mascheroni (1859–1941) was an Italian conductor and composer. He conducted the Italian premiere
of Beethoven’s Fidelio (1886), Catalani’s Wally, and Verdi’s
Falstaff. He also composed some operas. Edoardo Perelli
(1842–1885) was a composer and journalist. He wrote some
interesting anti-Wagnerian articles for the Gazzetta musicale di Milano (see Carlo Matteo Mossa 1988, 41). Gustavo
Adolfo Noseda (1837–1866) was a composer and collector.
His important collection of rare editions and manuscripts is
now in the library of the Milan conservatory.

Esercizi d’armonia is set in two volumes. The first is dedicated to a theoretical discussion and to the forty-two partimenti. The second is called Chiave
(Key) and consists of full realizations of all the partimenti in book 1, thus
offering students the opportunity to check their own work against the author’s
templates. Boucheron clearly assesses the intent of his book in the preface:
Why a new Partimenti collection, after the well-known works by Sala, Fenaroli,
Mattei, and others, and in a time in which many people regard this approach
to harmony as almost useless? . . . I appreciate more than others the works of
these revered maestri who preceded me . . . nor shall I ever cease to recommend their study. But, at the same time, I would argue that from the days in
which Sala, Fenaroli, and Mattei composed their partimenti to the present,
Harmony . . . has gained such a momentum . . . and has begun searching for
such effects, which our well-deserving [authors] had never dared to think.11

The first volume begins with six chapters devoted to the rules of partimenti.
In these chapters, Boucheron offers a remarkably French-flavored version of
Neapolitan rules, as Emanuele Imbimbo did half a century earlier (Cafiero
this issue). The first chapter is devoted to the basic rules of harmony: intervals, the concepts of fundamental bass, consonance/dissonance, inversion,
and the different types of triads and seventh chords (Boucheron [1867], 5–9).
The second chapter is titled “Dell’origine e ragione degli anzidetti accordi”
(“On the Origin and Purpose of the Above-Mentioned Chords”). In this chapter Boucheron introduces the by then common notion of tonality being based
on scale degrees I, IV, and V (Boucheron [1867], 10). But he adds a discussion
that is doubly reminiscent of Rameau’s concept of double emploi, and of François-Joseph Fétis’s notion of appellative tendencies. If we consider IV as one
ˆ
of the pillars of tonality, the sixth that is often added above 4 in the bass would
change this triad into a II. But Boucheron says that the added dissonance does
not modify the nature of that chord, but only confers to it a more intense striving toward its goal (as does the seventh when added to the triad on V). In his
ensuing discussion of the Rule of the Octave, in the standard Fenaroli version,
he calls cadenze all the descending fifth-progressions along the scale. In doing
so, he departs considerably from Neapolitan theory, which considers cadenze
only those progressions involving root-position dominant and tonic chords
(Boucheron [1867], 10). Later, at the end of his sixth chapter, Boucheron
will provide students with a detailed table of cadences (Boucheron [1867],
37–42).
11  “A qual pro’ una nuova opera di Partimenti, dopo le celebri
di Sala, di Fenaroli, Mattei e più altri, ed in un tempo, in cui
questo modo di studiare l’armonia è da molti stimato quasi
inutile? . . . io apprezzo, quanto altri mai, le opere di quei
venerandi maestri che mi precedettero; . . . ne cesserò mai
di raccomandarne lo studio; ma osserverei in pari tempo,
che dall’epoca, in cui Sala, Fenaroli, Mattei composero i loro
partimenti, ai di nostri, l’Armonia, . . . ha preso uno slancio . . . e si è avviata in cerca di effetti, ai quali i benemeriti
non avrebbero mai osato pensare.
”

Gaetano Stella 

  Partimenti in the Age of Romanticism

The third chapter is titled “Del ritmo” (“On Rhythm”). Boucheron
explains the difference between strong accent and weak accent, underlining
the importance of rhythm in music. As an example, he shows the necessity
for the strong accent on a tonic chord that ends an authentic cadence, or on
a dominant chord that ends a half cadence—the rhythm and the harmony
must coincide. He writes: “The cadence, therefore, essentially belongs to the
domain of rhythm. This element exerts such an influence on it that, if the
harmonic motion does not coincide with it, there is no closure”12 (Boucheron
[1867], 13).
The fourth chapter deals with voice leading and with the resolution
of dissonant chords. He discusses here all possible bass motions, trying to
simplify and rationalize the traditional series of motions offered by the Neapolitan maestros. Boucheron considers only six possibilities for the motion
of the fundamental bass: a third, a fifth, or a seventh, either up or down. In
this chapter, Boucheron lists all possible resolutions for the six types of seventh chords that he classifies in “species” (this classification was customary
among Italian theorists of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries;
JMT 51:1 149-3 Stella ex. 8
see Example 8).

Unlike Neapolitan theory, which considered consonant all the chords
contained in the Rule of the Octave (Sanguinetti in press), Boucheron considers the dominant seventh chord dissonant, as well as all the other types of
seventh chords. Then he shows some possible resolutions of the diminished
seventh chord, the diminished triad, and the augmented triad (Boucheron
[1867], 14–22).
In the fifth chapter Boucheron further expands some aspects of the
voice leading. He presents the motion of the parts (parallel, contrary, and
oblique). The sixth and final chapter is titled “Degli accordi composti e
del pedale” (“On Compound Chords and on the Pedal Point”; Boucheron
[1867], 27–32). Boucheron calls those chords that result from a suspension
“compound chords.” He points out that the second chord of a suspension
contains the note of resolution and then gives a series of examples listing the
difference between 4–3, 7–6, and 9–8 suspensions. The chapter ends with a
short presentation of anticipations, presented as the opposite of suspensions,
and, in a short paragraph at the very end, of pedal points.
The theoretical part of the book is followed by the forty-two partimenti.
While most nineteenth-century maestros encouraged, as we have seen, a written-out practice of realizing partimenti, Boucheron, throughout his treatise,
refers several times to keyboard practice. He expresses his views on this regard
in the following remark:
It is better to warn that on the piano, as on the organ, it is not always possible
to achieve a voice leading of the same perfection as in a four-voice vocal or
instrumental composition, unless one divides the chords between the two
hands according to the proper extension of vocal parts as soprano, alto, tenor
and bass. This kind of realization, called by La Croix “by extension,” although
more correct, is less easy for the beginners than the common way, that is, playing the chords with the right hand and only the bass with the left. . . . Since in
our realization we adhered to the second manner, it follows that in those partimenti where the harmony is joined with a melodic thought or figure, some
unavoidable transpositions will occur that would not happen in the other way.13
(Boucheron [1867], 26)

All the partimenti are written with complete figures and on two staves: the
actual partimento is in the upper staff, and a fundamental bass is in the lower
one.14 The figures used by Boucheron prescribe exactly the position of the

13  “Conviene avvertire che sul piano forte come sull’organo
non si può sempre ottenere un andamento di parti della
medesima perfezione richiesta in una composizione di
quattro parti vocali o strumentali distinte, se non dividendo
gli accordi fra le due mani e dando loro a un di presso
l’estensione, quale avrebbero quattro parti vocali, come
soprano, contralto, tenore e basso. Questo modo però,
che il La-Croix chiama per estensione, se riesce più corretto, riesce al principiante meno facile di quello più comunemente usato per eseguire gli accordi intieramente colla

mano destra, incaricando la sinistra del solo basso. . . . A
questo ci siamo per tanto attenuti nella Chiave, onde in
quei partimenti che all’armonia accoppiano un pensiero o
disegno melodico accadono spesso inevitabili trasposizioni
che non occorrerebbero nell’altro sistema.
”
14  The fundamental bass in association with partimenti had
already been discussed by Giacomo Tritto (1816).

Gaetano Stella 

  Partimenti in the Age of Romanticism

parts in the realization. They are also very detailed, including decorative
motions like passing and neighbor tones. Boucheron’s use of complete figuring differs, however, from the contemporary practice of republishing old
partimenti collections with newly added figures. In his case, we find musical
situations that the old partimento theory would have been unable to classify
and to realize. Boucheron writes:
I publish this work only after having used it with the few students for whom I
wrote it. [In this work], whenever possible, I have added to the bare harmony a
genuine melody, in order to give satisfaction to the tastes and minds of the
youth. In order to do this, I made use of unusual figures, not commonly used,
but necessary to show—or to hint at—the [musical] idea. In doubtful or difficult cases, the student should seek advice in the part [of this book] titled La
chiave (The Key), where the same ideas are written down in full notation.15
(Boucheron [1867], preface)

In doing so, Boucheron follows the opposite path of Platania. The latter
rejects the use of figures and insists on the utility (for the students) of finding
the correct solution for themselves, provided that they have the appropriate
theoretical background. By contrast, Boucheron chooses to give all the figures
as a practical demonstration of the new harmonic possibilities.
Boucheron—like a great many of his contemporaries—felt that partimenti pertained to the study of harmony, not counterpoint. Accordingly
Boucheron’s partimenti never show obvious traces of fugal or contrapuntal
procedures. No longer connected with partimenti, counterpoint became a
separate domain of knowledge pursued in separate studies.
In the work of Boucheron, partimenti have the added purpose of
acquainting students with common formal schemes. Usually these partimenti
have a period-shaped theme inside an A–B–A form with a shortened reprise
of the A section (as was seen in the advanced partimenti of Platania). The
B section is often in a relative key or in a third-relation key. This, too, was a
typical feature of nineteenth-century Italian instrumental music (Rostagno
2003, 73).
In Example 9, from Boucheron’s partimenti, it is possible to observe
some of the stylistic and harmonic characteristics pointed out earlier (the
examples show realizations by Boucheron himself). One can see very clearly
that Boucheron obtains chromatic chords mainly by using chromaticized passing tones in an otherwise structurally diatonic frame. For example, in bar 1

enharmonic reinterpretation of a dominant seventh V of V (reached in bar
25) as an augmented sixth chord on ≤VI of A≤ major.
Partimento: The Late Years

In the latter part of the nineteenth century, partimenti became less and less
important in Italian musical pedagogy. The only exception was Fenaroli,
whose Partimenti and regole were continuously in print until 1936 (Sanguinetti
in press). In some restricted circles, particularly in Naples, vestiges of the original richness of this repertory still survived. This continuation (or perhaps
rediscovery) was made possible by the emergence of musical historicism and
a renewed appreciation of the art from earlier centuries—it was perhaps no
accident that the greatest Italian exponent of historicism, Benedetto Croce,
lived in Naples.
When the composer, pianist, and pedagogue Florestano Rossomandi
(1857–1933) was a student in the Naples conservatory, he realized, under the
guidance of his teacher Luigi Vespoli, various partimenti by Fenaroli in a style
that recaptures some elements of harpsichord style (e.g., trillos and acciaccaturas; Rossomandi 1874, bk. 2, no. 29).
While there were, as mentioned, numerous editions of Fenaroli, other
musicians preferred to publish anthologies of “ancient” authors. In 1896,
D
­ aniele Napoletano published a collection of partimenti by Nicola Sala
(Napoletano 1896). In 1933, Camillo De Nardis, one of the last of the partimento maestros, published a collection by various authors, a sort of Neapolitan anthology of partimenti (De Nardis 1933). And what was probably
the final collection of partimenti to come from within the direct tradition of
Neapolitan maestros was edited by Jacopo Napoli and published in 1959.
In the late nineteenth century, the practice of partimento as improvisation at the keyboard on a given bass remained almost the exclusive preserve
of organ pedagogy. At the Palermo conservatory, Carmelo Fodale, a pupil
of Pietro Raimondi in the 1880s, taught partimento at the organ.16 Guido
Tacchinardi, Florentine composer and organist, composed his Saggi di basso
numerato e di contrappunto (Figured Bass and Counterpoint Exercises) as “preparatory study for the interpretation of the music in the tied style . . . adopted by
the organ school of the Royal College of Music in Florence” (Tacchinardi
1886).17 The latter collection includes the totally figured, chromatic partimento reproduced in Example 10 (Partimento cromatico; Tacchinardi 1886,
44). As with Boucheron, the figures indicate the exact disposition of the voices
in a way that makes realization an almost mechanical task. On the one hand,
this represents an advantage: performers do not need any prior knowledge of
16  The name of Carmelo Fodale as teacher of partimento
al melodium recurs in some uncatalogued documents that
have been found recently in the library of the conservatory
in Palermo (Anonymous, uncataloged).

harmony and counterpoint to complete a realization. But on the other hand,
they cannot hope to gain any intimate acquaintance with the laws of composition that the old partimento practice assured. The harmonization of this
partimento strays far from the Neapolitan rules. The chromatic motions of
the bass, for example, are accompanied differently from what was possible in
Fenaroli. Dissonant and chromatically altered chords resolve to other altered
chords in an uninterrupted flux, and a strong cadence is found only at the
very end of the composition (not shown in Example 10).
Conclusions

All the authors discussed exemplify different aspects of the nineteenth-century practice of partimenti. The collections in use remained the same for most
of the century: Fenaroli’s above all, but also some by Carlo Cotumacci and
Mattei. The collections of earlier masters like Leo, Alessandro Scarlatti, and
Durante were far less used, perhaps because of their lack of a clear pedagogical progression and perhaps because they were more wedded to an archaic
style. The greatest change, however, concerned the use of partimenti. At the
beginning of the nineteenth century, the partimento was still a tool used for a
global approach to composition teaching, just as it was in the previous century.
Through the partimento, students learned not only how to place the proper
harmonies above a bass, but also how to shape a complete piece of music in a
given style. During the nineteenth century, the partimento gradually became
something entirely different—an exercise in harmony. On the one hand, classic works by Fenaroli were being realized in a four-voice, steadily progressing,
block-chordal style. On the other hand, newly composed exercises (like those
discussed in this essay) became little more than basses for harmonization,
even if retaining the traditional name of partimenti. A clear sign of this shift
is the disappearance of one typical feature of the real partimento: the change
of clefs. In fact, eighteenth-century partimenti usually moved freely from one
voice of the texture to another and, except for the simplest partimenti, rarely
confined themselves to the bass voice alone. Another significant change was
the gradual disappearance of contrapuntal features like imitation, canons, and
fugal procedures. An entire genre of partimento (perhaps the most important
of all), the partimento fugue, disappeared entirely from pedagogical practice.
Its place was taken by the new genre of exercise, the basso imitato e fugato.
But the decisive element, the one that caused the definitive twilight of
the partimento tradition, was its divorce from improvisation. Only through
practice in the improvised realization of partimenti could students fully
develop their potential, fashioning in their minds a deeply rooted compositional instinct. The shift from improvisation to written practice marked the
end of a centuries-long and glorious tradition.
