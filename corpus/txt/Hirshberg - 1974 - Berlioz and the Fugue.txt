The only attempt to isolate the question of Berlioz and the fugue
and to approach it objectively was that of Georges Favre in his
valuable in
essay "Berlioz et la fugue, "':8 which is especially

Since neither the

original prints of the Correspondant nor the reprint in Prod'homme's old book are always available to the reader, it would
appear helpful to quote the whole relevant section:
All the ancient productions of Italy and of Germany are
infected by the fugal style; barbaric, ridiculous, absurd,
and yet preached by the generality of artists and presented
by masters to the admiration of pupils. I can see the admirers of fugue directing their enraged looks at me, but I
am not writing for them. I am addressing myself only to
reason disengaged from prejudice of the real friends of
art.
Theyare going to tell me: is it due to you, then, that fugue
is taught at the schools? Of course not; it is a highly usethe pupils with many harful exercise which familiarizes
monic difficulties and instructs them how to derive all possibilities from a melodic idea. It is likewise proper to add
that the fugal style can be sometimes used in a modified
manner in slow movements with good results; but the way
in which it has been employed until now is in my opinion
an incredible aberration of the intellect of the composers.
They should, at least, seek the way to unite this genre of
music with words whose meaning would make it possible
to tolerate, as done by Jomelli in his piece Movendi sunt
coeli et terra.
Yet, common practice requires that the

155
composer of a Mass would set fugues to the words Amen,
Kyrie, or Agnus dei. Let the people who have never heard
it figure out the religious effect which must result from
fifty voices brawling with rage in a very fast tempo, repeating the word Amen four or five hundred times, vocalizing on the syllable A in a manner of imitation of violent
bursts of laughter, and they would form an idea of the voI
cal fugue, which very likely would not be favorable.
challenge anyone who is endowed with musical feeling and
who listens without bias to an Amen fugue not to consider
the chorus as a legion of incarnated devils turning the sacred sacrifice into ridicule rather than as a reunion of the
faithful assembled to sing in praise of God.
It is not less shocking to see the same practice applied to
the two prayers, Kyrie and Agnus. Still, there is nothing
more common than that; it is a style adopted by musicians,
this is what they call reliand, even more inconceivable,
of
gious style, indeed, which substitutes the expression

positions smashed and crushed the barriers of routine,
he who followed the impulse of his genius and of high reasons, he himself descended in several sections of the Missa
Solemnis to the level of the contrapuntists.
Some people use a peculiar reason to justify the introduction of fugal style into church music: A Mass does not
have to be moving, they say; and a fugue is not moving, it
is interesting; the intellect follows with pleasure the various combinations made by the composer; one likes to see
how he overcomes the difficulties imposed on him by the

which is quite significant if one remembers
enough reasons to feel certain hostility toward the formal fugue
in 1829. He is opposed to fugue only when its use is not justified by the text.
There is no need to quote the well-known
lengthy paragraph from the Treatise on Instrumentation. >10
Again, Berlioz directs his criticism against a certain type of
organ fugue, the poor standard of which was acknowledged by

156
Richard Strauss in his revision of the Treatise. '11 A similar
comment in the Memoires makes it clear that he always objects to specific compositions and not to fugal style in general:
". . .there must have been some grave reason, which I have
forgotten, for my apparent indifference in the matter of sacred
music, or I must have been entirely overwhelmed by the terror
of gigues for the organ and fugues on the word Amen. "'-12 On

it seems that Berlioz's opinions were shared by Reicha and by
Lesueur, although the two old masters had no motivation to
become involved in heated debates on the subject. '14

discussion concentrates on matters of special interest for him,
like sonority, volume, diversity of sound, and the placing of
on the stage. It would appear that if he had

felt any real hatred for counterpoint, he would have made some
unfavorable comments on the music, which he does not.
Even more revealing are Berlioz's essays on Beethoven's symphonies. *17 It is remarkable that Berlioz ignores Beethoven's
fugues and fugatos almost completely in his thorough analyses.

finale simply as a "theme fugue, "-18 but he ignores the two

with regard to a section in the finale, which is entitled fugato

only a fugato is certainly not by Bach but is nevertheless
clearly
constructed according to the rules. "*25 There are certainly
many more fugal sections in Berlioz' s works which would qualify
as fugues according to Schumann's criteria.
It seems that the somewhat vague distinction between fugue and

fugato caused confusion with regard to Berlioz's music.
LaRue's definition can be used as a useful guideline: "Fugal
beginnings that do not progress beyond the exposition to genuine
development of the subject are often called fugatos, a useful
distinction for style analysis.
Thus, if we encounter a series
of fugal entries in the development of a sonata form, we would
refer to this as a fugato rather than a fugue, unless it actually
to further development of the fugal subject. "*26
progressed
Even LaRue's standard cannot be invariably applied. In certain cases even a single exposition will qualify as fugue, taking
into consideration its function and proportionate length in the
movement of which it is part.

to provide a systematic description of his fugal procedures as

to be of special significance in Berlioz's fugues:

Is there a countersubject

Are the entries spaced at regular distances (the spacing
is marked by the number of measures which separate
the entries from one another)?*'27

'31 The imitative motive undergoes diminution, with entries spaced at distances of four,
then two, and finally one measure from one another. The passage is chromatic and harmonically ambiguous, and it leads to
the recapitulation in m.412.

avoidance of a countersubject
appears to be the constant harmonic modification.
The two-part counterpoint in the second

On
the other hand, the four-part writing in the fourth entry obscures the dominant and directs the harmony toward the tonic,

Part II (scene four) begins with a fugue which belongs to the
large group of Berlioz's slow fugues. Yet the subject, unlike
those of the Offertorium from the Requiem and the Convoi
funebre from Romeo et Juliette, is not longer than any conventional fugue subject. The fugue consists of an exposition (mm.

that the contrapuntal material is continuously varied with each
entry, reaching an excited climax with the syncopated countermelody of the counterexposition

Te Deum (1850)
The Te Deum begins with Berlioz's longest and harmonically
most complex fugue. The movement consists of three principal sections separated from one another by strong cadences.
The architectonic structure is further articulated by means of
recurring passages.

Elaborate contrapuntal treatment continues in the next section,
in which a modified version of the countersubject
prevails.
The contrapuntal division of the ensemble is used by Berlioz
to produce the monumental effect, which, as pointed out by
Berlioz himself more than ten years before the completion of
Les Troyens, cannot be achieved by merely employing a large
group of performers.
No doubt grand music like the oratorios of Handel, Bach,
Haydn, and Beethoven gains very much by being thus performed; but after all, in this case it is only a question of
more or less doubling the parts, whereas a composer
writing for such a colossal orchestra and choir, and acwould inevitably
quainted with their manifold resources,
produce something as novel in detail as it would be grand
in its entirety.
This has never yet beendone. In all works
considered as monumental, the form and tissue are alike.
They are produced with all pomp in huge halls, but would
not lose much if heard in a smaller room, with fewer performers. *39

part of larger compositions, there are specific factors which influence or determine the choice of pattern. For example, the dance rhythm of four-measure phrases of the scherzo of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 imposes itself on
the fugal exposition which opens the movement, and the meditative style of the
first movement of the C# minor quartet (op. 131) is further enhanced by the
regularly spaced fugal entries.

It is noteworthy that a similar, though much simpler, harmonic extension occurs at the end of the Lacrymosa section of the Requiem of Cherubini (composed
in 1836). Cherubini sets no fugues on Amen, Kyrie, and Agnus dei, and it is
remarkable that the Requiem of the master of academic counterpoint is on the
whole less contrapuntal thanthat of the "rebel" Berlioz.

Another example of a monotone is the Judex credere from the Te Deum, in
which the static effect is counterbalanced through bold harmonic modulations.
The harmonic shifts, however, force Berlioz to change the pitch of the monotone, which is not the case with the two fugues.
