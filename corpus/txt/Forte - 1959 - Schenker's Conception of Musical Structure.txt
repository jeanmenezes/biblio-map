the prolonged fundamental line component varies, depending upon which

specific prolongation motions occur at the background level.
Before explaining the middleground,
I should like to direct attention again to the diminution which spans the third below C-sharp

indicate that the second C-sharp (black
notehead) is a dissonant passing-tone,
and therefore is not to be equated
with the initial C-sharp, which serves as the point of departure for the
fundamental line. The adjacent tone D recurs in m. 14, where Schenker
assigns more structural weight to it, as indicated by the stem. I reiterate that conventional durational values are used in the analytic
sketches to indicate the relative position of a given component or configuration in the tonal hierarchy -the greater the durational value, the
closer the element to the background.

14. Undoubtedly Schenker compressed
many of his sketches in
consideration
of the practical requirements
of publication.

inner voice which descends from G-sharp to E, a middleground duplication of the fundamental line's third. The bass which counterpoints
this inner voice arpeggiates the tonic triad, E-C-sharp-A.
Schenker
shows how the arpeggiation is partially filled in by the passing tone, D,
and by slurring E to A he indicates that he considers that motion to be
the controlling bass motion, within which the C-sharp functions as a
connective of primarily melodic significance. 16 Here we have an example of the careful distinction which Schenker always draws between
major bass components or Stufen, which belong to the backgroundlevel,
and more transient, contrapuntal-melodic
events at the foreground and
middleground levels.
A brief consideration of three additional events will complete our
examination of the middleground level. First, observe that the diatonic
inner-voice descent in the middle section, G-sharp-E,
is filled in by a
chromatic passing-tone,
G. Schenker has enclosed this in parentheses
to indicate that it belongs to a subsidiary level within the middleground.
Second, observe that just before the inner-voice motion is completed on
the downbeat of m. 12, the G-sharp, its point of departure, is restated
by an additional voice which is introduced above it.
Schenker has
pointed out that in "free" compositions,

of more elaborate prolongation is greatly inworks, the possibility
creased by introducing additional voices,
as well as by abandoning
voices already stated. The final event to observe here occurs in the
middle section: the motion from B, the retained upper voice, to C-sharp
on the downbeat of m. 12. This direct connection does not actually occur at the foreground level, but Schenker, feeling that it is strongly imthe implied C-sharp in
plied by the voice-leading
context, encloses
parentheses and ties it to the actual C-sharp, thereby indicating that it
is an anticipation.
In the foreground sketch Schenker represents
for the first time
the metrical organization of the song. As I have already mentioned, he
shows there some of the actual durational values, in addition to using
these as sketch symbols.
This reveals the position assigned to meter
and rhythm in his system: he considered them to be important structural determinants at the middleground and foreground levels but subsidiary to the fundamental tn
organization,
which, he maintained,
was arhythmic.
I shall return to this further on when I consider the
general problem of constructing a theory of rhythm for tonal music.
Let us now examine some of the relationships
which Schenker
has shown in his sketch of the foreground, this time beginning with the
bass.
In m. 3 he encloses the bass-note A in parentheses
and marks it

It should be apparent that an analysis of this kind embraces all the information generally included under the heading "form and analysis" but
that it goes far beyond to interpret the relationships
to the background
which are revealed during its initial phases, where the main concern is
to achieve an accurate reading of foreground and middleground.
A summary of this analysis should properly include a classification of the chromatic chords in the middle section of the piece, and a
more precise explanation of the coordination of linear intervals at the
foreground level, the descending thirds and fifths (which latter take the
form of diminished fifths and ascending fourths in the middle section).
However, because of space limitations,
I shall not undertake a sum18. Cf. Johann David Heinichen, Der General-Bass

as I have pointed out, is central to Schenker's theory, was first set
forth in the analyses published in Der Tonwille (1921-24).
However,
the idea of the background and its essential content, the fundamental
structure, did not emerge clearly until many years later; not until the
publication of Der Freie Satz (1935) was it definitively stated. Schenker
was very much aware, in retrospect, of the development of Ursatz conmeans which he so closely associated with
cept andthe representational
it. Thus, in the introduction to Der Freie Satz he remarks (with characteristic pride): "Since the task of being the first to discover the background world in music devolved upon me I was not spared the difficulty
of finding symbols which would represent it, a task which required

past in considerable detail (his Kontrapunkt for example includes quotations from Fux, Albrechtsberger,
Cherubini), he did

allegations of arbitrariness,
with the traditions of music, suggest that an explanation is in order.
In brief, the analytic technique of reduction derives from the compositional technique of variation, as it developed during the tonal period. 21

underlying,
Although Schenker
amplified and refined this procedure, it is far from being his innovation. Reductions of a rudimentary kind are to be found in, for example,
many of the 16th-century textbooks on diminution, in the 17th-century
writings of Bernhard, and in the 18th-century tome on figured-bass by
Heinichen (see footnote 18). The latter author makes extensive use of
reductions to explain the process of Verwechslung
(prolongation, in
Schenker's terms) as well as to analyze certain passages purported to
be "incorrect" by colleagues. All of these treatises lend strong support
to Schenker's musical thought and, on the negative side, demonstrate
the extent to which 19th-century theorists obscured the relationship between theory and practice so firmly established at the close of the 18th
century.
In Schenker's early analyses, the reduction technique served to
reveal only the sub-levels within the foreground and to a certain extent
the middleground.
Thus, the Urlinie of 1921 is not the Urlinie of Der
Freie Satz. The latter is a single linear progression
which spans the
whole work under specific contrapuntal conditions. The Urlinie of 1921
corresponds more closely to what Schenker ultimately would designate
a Zug (linear progression) at the middleground level. Thus, with the development and refinement of the concept of structural levels, Schenker,
went beyond mere
probing ever more deeply into musical structure,
reduction and description; he began to interpret the reduction with
reference to a unique conception of structural coherence,
a bold and
imaginative formulation of the organizing forces of triadic tonality.
While doing this, he greatly enlarged the traditional notions of harmony and counterpoint and at the same time made them far more

dimension and the bass arpeggiation represents the harmonic.
Critics of Schenker seem to fall into two general categories: in
the first are those who reject his attitude toward music and music
study, and in the secnd are those who reject either part or all of his
theoretical system.
Of the latter group of critics, by far the largest
22. Curiously enough, Schenker did not explain in his writings
how to carry out a reduction.
Whatever his reasons for this may have
been, he is probably being sarcastic when he suggests in Der Freie
Satz thatthe reader who wishes to arrive atthe deeper structurallevels
need only apply the method of reducing more extended diminutions
which is taught in all schools and textbooks. Such an undertaking, even
would be like transsupposing the student grasped the bare essentials,

how to go about composing. And despite the implication of its title, Der
Freie Satz (free composition) is an instructional book not on composition, but on analysis. Let there be no doubt on this point, Schenker was
outspokenly against any efforts to use the concept of fundamental structure for the purpose of composing music. To him, music study, represented at the highest level by analysis, makes an essential contribution

concern about the current state of affairs in music seems to have been
an important motivation for all of his writings.
At the beginning of the
first volume of his Kontrapunkt (1910) he declaims:
We stand before a Herculaneum and Pompeii of music; muThe tonal material itself
sical civilization is obstructed!
is destroyed, those essentials of music which were created
went
by artists, who, working with their own resources,
far beyond the meager indications of the overtone system.37
Nor did time modify his opinion. Some sixteen years later in Jahrbuch
II he undertook an analysis of a passage from Stravinsky's Piano Concerto, concluding:
My analysis gives me the right to say that Stravinsky's
work, despite its slight suggestions of linear progressions,
which has to do with the folk-like elements it contains, is
and unmusical.
altogether bad, inartistic,
In view of these and other statements, it seems contradictory that
Schenker's work should contribute significantly to the solution of certain problems in advanced contemporary music.
Yet, his general concept of structure, apart from his specific formulations of triadic tonal
events, lends itself to modernthought regarding music.38 For example,
the idea of the "totally organized" work, now become quite fashionable,
was clearly set forth by Schenker (but without reference to Webern!).
He even recognized the structural role of orchestration
and demonstrated this in his analyses, notably in those of the Scherzo to Beethoven's Third Symphony and the G-minor Symphony of Mozart. Relevant
to this, he writes in Der Freie Satz:
In the masterworks,
orchestral colors are not combined
according to (the composer's) mood, and applied haphazardly. They are subject to the laws of the total composition.39
37. Schoenberg, in the first edition of his Harmonielehre (1911),
took exception to this as follows: "Dr. Heinrich Schenker (I hear) writes
in a new counterpoint book of the art of composition, and maintains that
no one can compose any longer.
Certainly Dr. Schenker is a thinker
whom one must take seriously,
(even though nothing correct is to be

gained from it), for he is one of the few who strive for a system.
if he makes the same mistake as others, one must nevertheless
value
him for other merits.
But what he says is hardly better than the remarks of the senile about 'the good old days!'"
In the 1922 edition
Schoenberg changed his remark about "nothing correct to be gained" to
read "although he brings nothing to full clarity!' Schenker reciprocated
by attacking Schoenberg's Harmonielehre in Jahrbuch II (1926).
38. Roger Sessions recognized this as early as 1935 when he
wrote: "Although Schenker remained bitterly hostile to all that is contemporary in music, his work and his ideas nevertheless
embody very
clearly certain aspects of contemporary
musicality. . . " ("Heinrich
Schenker's Contribution" Modern Music, XII:170-8.)

initial problem in the analysis of a work from the period under discussion is to discover a clue which will reveal its basic structural terms.
To illustrate the application of Schenker-derived
techniques toward the
solution of this problem, I present here a partial analysis of Debussy's
La Cathedrale Engloutie (1910), a work which is familiar and relatively
but which deviates considerably
from triadic norms,
uncomplicated,
despite certain external triadic characteristics.
A careful examination ofthe first measure, in the course of which
all doublings are eliminated to show the basic components in their most
condensed form, yields an incomplete succession
of parallel fourths
above a sustained "bass" note (Ex. 10a). The fact that the lower line
in this succession
is incomplete compared to the upper, suggests that
it will eventually complete itself, that is, E will ascend to F-sharp,
thus paralleling completely the motion of the upper voice.
This provides a clue, at least, to the melodic structure.
The tendency of E to
ascend is strengthened with each repetition and with the placement of

fourths like that at the beginning. This succession prolongs the central
tones, E and B (Ex. 10b). Observe that, unlike the opening succession,
the lower voice of the succession is complete.
At m. 13 the bass continues its descent, arriving at C. Following this, the initial parallel fourths succession is repeated (mm. 14-15),
reinforced here by another parallel succession,
A-B, added in the lower
staff.
Finally at m. 16, the melodic connection from E to F-sharp,
suggested at the very outset, is completed, and as the inner voice ascends to F-sharp, the bass descends to B. Ex. 10c) summarizes

does occur.

Thus, to use Schenker's terms, the structural content of the upper
voice at the middleground level is an ascending whole-tone scale.
