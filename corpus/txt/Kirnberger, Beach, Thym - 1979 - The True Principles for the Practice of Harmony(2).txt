THE TRUE PRINCIPLES
FOR THE
PRACTICE OF HARMONY

by Johann Philipp Kirnberger

Translated by David W. Beach
and Jurgen Thym

INTRODUCTIONTO THE TRANSLATION
DavidBeach
One of the most importantfiguresin the developmentof harmonic
theory during the eighteenth century was Johann Philipp Kirnberger
and
(1721-1783). His writingswere well known to his contemporaries
had considerable influence on future generationsof musicians. Considering his stature, it is interesting to note that Kirnbergerwould
probably never have committed his ideas to paperhad it not been for
the assistance and encouragementof two men-Johann Georg Sulzer
(1720-1779), an aesthetician, and Johann Abraham Peter Schulz
student.
(1747-1800), Kimberger's
came in contact with
Shortly after his arrivalin Berlin Kirnberger
Sulzer, who sought someone to give him instruction in music theory
and to provide information for the music articles in his Allgemeine
Theorie der schonen Kiinste.1 In doing so, Kirnbergerwas forced to
formulate his ideas about music, particularlythose about harmony.
163

This collaboration led first to the publication of Volume 1 of his
magnum opus, Die Kunst des reinen Satzes in der Musik, and
subsequently to publication of the first volume of the Sulzer work,
both in 1771. In 1773 Schulz, who had studied with Kimberger from
1765 to 1768, returned to Berlin. He became increasingly involved in
the preparation of the music articles for the second volume of the
Sulzer, writing those from the letter S on without assistance from
either Kimberger or Sulzer.2 During that time he became acquainted
with the first volume of Kirnberger's treatise, which had been published in his absence. According to Schulz, his assimilation of this
material led to still another publication.
I had just recently made a systematic reduction of his [Kirnberger's]
principles of harmony for my own benefit and satisfaction, and at
his request I had applied this system practically to the analysis of
two pieces by Joh. Seb. Bach.... The teacher was pleased with his
student's work and permitted it to be published under his name by
Decker in Berlin as an appendix to his Kunst des reinen Satzes, with
the title proposed by Sulzer: Die wahren Grundsdtze zum Gebrauch
der Harmonie. 3
It seems likely that Schulz also helped Kirnberger in the preparation of
Volume 2, Part 1, of Die Kunst des reinen Satzes, which was first
published in 1776. The subsequent two parts, which deal exclusively
with double counterpoint, were written by Kirnberger and published
in 1777 and 1779 respectively. Two years later he published an
additional work, Grundsdtze des Generalbasses, as an introduction to
his major treatise.
Although Die wahren Grundsdtze zum Gebrauch der Harmonie-the
work translated here-was not written by Kirnberger, it is, with the few
exceptions noted below, a concise and accurate summary of his
harmonic theories.4 Here, as elsewhere, a combination of innovative
thought and conservative attitude is evident. Certainly Kirnberger's
definition of essential and non-essential dissonance was a major contribution to the advancement of harmonic theory. Yet in his attitude
toward the treatment of dissonance, and in his clear preference for the
old "strict" style (as opposed to the newer "gallant" style), he revealed
his strong ties with the past. This latter attitude is most clearly
expressed in Section 17 of the following translation.5
There can be no doubt that Kirnberger's conception of harmony
and the relationship between vertical and linear components in music
has its roots in the German tradition of figured bass. However, in
Kirnberger's writings this tradition is mixed with certain ideas borrowed
from Jean-Philippe Rameau (1683-1764), and the final product may
in some ways be considered as a synthesis of the two. It should never164

did
theless be noted that Kirnberger not adopt Rameau'smathematicalacoustical approach to the subject, but simply borrowedsome of his
more practical ideas. Most obvious is his adoption of Rameau's
definition of chord inversion and the use of the fundamentalbass to
show the progression of the basic harmonies.6 Kirnberger,
however,
was outspoken in his opposition to Rameau'stheories and those of his
followers, and thus it is not surprising that he was unwilling to
acknowledge this influence. What is perhaps surprisingat first is the
extent to which Rameau's presence is evident in certain sections of
Die wahrenGrundsdtze
zum Gebrauch Harmonie.Most noteworthy
der
in this respect is Section 22, which contains rulesfor the progressionof
fundamental harmonies. These rules, which differ considerably from
those given in Die Kunst des reinen Satzes (Volume 2, Part 1, Chapter
1), are almost exactly the same as those given by Rameauin his Traite
de l'harmonie(1722). Also significantis the explanationaccompanying
Examples 77-79; here Rameau'sinfluence is unmistakable.These and
other passages(e.g., the explanation of parallelsixth chordsin Section
20) point to one fact-that in writing this work Schulz incorporated
some of his own ideas (borrowed from Rameau)along with those of
his teacher.
The most important feature of Die wahren Grundsdtze zum
Gebrauchder Harmonie is yet to be mentioned. This is the analytic
application of the fundamentalbass to two works by J. S. Bach, the
Clavier,I) and the first part of the
Fugue in B minor (Well-Tempered
Prelude in A minor (WTC, II).8 Here the relationship between Kirnberger's concept of harmony and Rameau's concept of the fundamental
bass, as applied by Schulz, is clearly demonstrated. The historical

significance of these analyses is twofold: (1) along with Kimberger's
analysis of his own Fugue in E minor (Die Kunst des reinenSatzes, I),
they arethe first attemptsby a Germantheorist of the period to explain
the harmonic structure of a musical composition; and (2) they constitute an importantstep in the developmentof harmonicanalysis.9
In the following translation certain liberties have been taken to
accommodate numbering and reference to the musical examples. Otherwise every effort has been made to represent the original text faithfully
and clearly in English.

NOTES
1. The first edition of Sulzer's encyclopedia was published in two volumes (Leipzig, 1771 and 1774); subsequent editions were published
in four volumes.

Kunste unter dem Artikel Verruckung angefiihrten zwey Beispiele
von Pergolesi und Graun...,"

dissertation, "The Harmonic Theories of Johann Philipp Kirnberger;

5. Here Schulz criticizes modern composers for their free and excessive
use of the chord of the diminished octave and sixth. It is interesting
to compare Examples 38-40 in this work to those given in Figure
257 (p. 216) of William Mitchell's translation of C. P. E. Bach's
Versuch iiber die wahre Art das Clavier zu spielen. Bach, whose work
appeared several years earlier, was not at all negative in his discussion
of this chord.
6. Kirnberger, however, makes an important distinction between the
consonant and the dissonant six-four chord, and in this respect
deviates from the literal conception of chord inversion expressed by
Rameau and his followers. It is also worth noting that while
Kirnberger's use of the fundamental bass is much the same as
Rameau's, the results of its use are very different because of their
opposing views of the relationship between linear and vertical
elements, and thus of what constitutes a fundamental harmony.
(For a discussion of the similarity between Rameau's and Kirnberger's use of the fundamental bass see Cecil Powell Grant's
article, "The Real Relationship between Kirnberger's and Rameau's
Concept of the Fundamental Bass," Journal of Music Theory, XXI
(1977), 324-38).
7. Other differences between this work and Die Kunst des reinen
Satzes can be found. One is Schulz's use of the term "Zwischenaccorde" to describe passing (non-fundamental) chords; although
Kirnberger discussed this phenomenon, he never used that term.
8. The fact that two such highly contrapuntal pieces were suggested by
Kirnberger as the subject for harmonic analysis is a clue to his
conception of the harmonic nature of counterpoint. This view is
significantly different from the traditional species approach to the
subject, codified by Fux in his Gradus ad Parnassum (1725).

PREFACE
The first part of my Art of Strict MusicalCompositionhas elicited
a letter in which I am requestedto reduce a certain well known Bach
fugue to its simple fundamentalchords in the same manner as I did
with one of my own fugues in the above-mentionedwork, pp. 248ff.
The author of this letter is one of our most accomplishedcomposers*,
and I value his praise too much not to consider his request as an
invitation from an entire musical audience and not to comply with it
immediately. No matter how easy this task would have been for me
accordingto my principlesof harmony, and no matterhow pleasantit
may always be for me to reveal at every opportunity the profound
harmonicknowledgeof the exalted composerof this fugue, nevertheless
it seemed essential for me to accompanyit with certain explanations
from which the basis of my method would be understood and the
matter safeguardedagainstall objections.This of coursecompelled me,
to
if I may say so, to state my entire creed of harmony,and particularly
explain my own theory of fundamentalchordsin a systematicmanner.
Rameau has filled this theory with so many absurditiesthat it is
have been able to find believers,
how such extravagances
simplyamazing
even defenders, among us Germans, since we have always had the
greatest composers among us whose treatment of harmony was
certainly not to be explained accordingto Rameau'sdoctrines. Some
went so far that they preferred to deny the thoroughnessof [even]
Bach's procedure with respect to the treatment and progression of
chords, ratherthan admit that the Frenchmancould have been wrong.
Those who have acquainted themselves with Rameau's doctrines will
soon notice in the course of this work how much mine differ from his
and which of the two explainsthe originand treatmentof chordsmost
simply and most naturally.
I flatter myself that in this brief work I have solved all harmonic
difficulties quite easily, that I have generallymade comprehensibleall
works of our greatestharmonists,and that I have shown how inferior
alone would have made
harmonistscould be recognized.This advantage
me decide to include these few pages as a supplement to my Art of
Strict Musical Composition,even if it were not obvioushow important
it is in strict polyphonic composition to understandthe fundamental
harmonies.

FOR THEPRACTICE HARMONY
OF
THETRUE PRINCIPLES
1.

All harmony is based on just two fundamentalchords.They are the
source of all other chords, and everything that is composed in the
strict style can be traced to them. These are: (a) the consonant triad,
which is either major, minor, or diminished; and (b) the dissonant
essential seventh chord, which can be formed in four ways: It consists
either of a minor seventh with a perfect fifth and a major or a minor
third; or with a diminished fifth and a minor third; or of a major
seventhwith a perfect fifth and a majorthird. [See Example 1.]
2.
Of these fundamental chords, the preceding one is always more
perfect harmonicallythan the one following it. Thus the major triad
is the most perfect of the consonant fundamentalchords, whereasthe
diminished triad is the least perfect; and the chord of the minor
seventh with perfect fifth and major third is the most perfect of the
dissonantfundamentalchords, whereasthe chord of the majorseventh
is the least perfect.
3.
Every note essential to these fundamentalchords can be relocated,
i.e., be made the bass note. Since every chord is designatedfrom its
lowest tone, this relocation produces various other chords that differ
from their fundamentalchords with respect to structureand strength;
these arerearranged invertedfundamentalchords,whose fundamental
or
bass is the same. Thus the triad in inversionleads to the sixth and
six-fourchords [Example2a]; andinversionof the seventhchord results
in the six-five, four-three, and second chords [Example 2b]. The
fundamentalharmony of the former is the triad, and of the latter the
essentialseventhchord.
4.
These chords that result from inversion are treated in exactly the
same way as their fundamentalchords, but differ in their degree of
harmonic perfection. Thus the fundamentalchord itself is the most
perfect, the first inversionless, the second even less than the first, and
the third even less than the preceding.2 These different degrees of
harmonic perfection-not only of the fundamentalchords themselves
(see paragraph2) but also of their inversions-produce a wonderful
diversityin harmony which has a great effect upon musicalexpression
and without which music would lose all its charm. [This is all the more
true] when one considers that every chord has three different
[soprano] positions over the same bass which also differ in their degree
of effectiveness.

In the progressionfrom one chord to another,each note that belongs
chords-no matterin which voice it is situatedto the above-mentioned
can be delayed by a tone that precedes it. It can be delayed either
alone or together with others, and from above or below. This tone
becomes dissonant and must resolve shortly thereafterto its essential
position, or resolve. This [procedure] results in a numberof dissonant
chords that resolve to the same fundamental chord, in relation to
which they are consideredas suspensions.The most useful of these can
be seen in TablesI and II.
The fundamentalchord of all the dissonantchords in Table I is the
C major triad. The seven-four-twochord marked with an asterisk,
where the suspension is in the bass as ninth from the root, is used
rarely and with discretion by great harmonists. The minor and
diminished triads and their inversions can be treated in this same
manner;but with the diminishedtriad some of these suspensionsare
less useful than others.
The fundamental bass of the chords in Table II is G with the
essential seventh chord. Anyone can easily display for himself the
suspensions of the less perfect seventh chords and their inversionsin
both major and minor keys by following this same procedure.In this
way the naturalorigin and treatment of all dissonantchords from the
simplest to the most unusual-of which examples that have remained
insoluble to many can be found on occasion in good harmonic
compositions-will be clearly specified and established, as will their
numberand the limit beyond which no chord can possibly exist.
6.

All dissonancesthat arise in this mannerfrom suspensionsare called
non-essential by us to distinguish them from the dissonance of the
seventh, which-we call essential. The formeraremost dissonantagainst
the note they displace, and their most perfect resolution occurs over
the same bass to the fundamentalchord [Example3a]. The essential
seventh, on the other hand, is not dissonantbecause it has taken the
place of a consonance;ratherit is dissonantbecauseit has been added
to consonant intervals, thus disruptingthe consonantharmony of the
triad,or at least makingit very imperfect. Since it does not substitute
for another note belonging to that bassnote, it cannot resolveover the
same fundamental bass, but absolutely requires an entirely different
harmony for its resolution [Example 3b]. Herein lies the distinction
between non-essentialand essentialdissonance.In the last example, the
fourth displacesthe third, and resolves over the same bass note; thus it
is non-essential.However,the seventhcannot resolveuntil the following
harmony;thus it is essential.

The Essential Seventh Chord with the suspension in the bass

175

7.
The essential dissonance can occur on a weak as well as a strong beat,
whereas the non-essential dissonance can occur only on a strong beat.
8.
From the foregoing it is evident that all intervals, even those that are
originally consonant, can become non-essential dissonances when they
are displacements of notes necessary to the fundamental chord. Thus
there are two types of six-four chord, namely the consonant, which is
the second inversion of the triad, and the dissonant, where the sixth
displaces the fifth and the fourth displaces the third. These two types
must be distinguished from one another, since they differ with respect
to fundamental harmony and, therefore, with respect to treatment.
Their principal distinguishing characteristics are as follows:
In the dissonant six-four chord, the fifth and the third can always
be sounded in place of the sixth and the fourth. In the consonant, this
cannot happen. [See Example 4.] In the six-four chord of the first
measure (*) it is not possible to sound the fifth in place of the sixth;
therefore it is consonant, and has as its fundamental chord the triad on
the fifth degree below the bass. Because this consonant fourth is the
octave of the root, it can be introduced freely, like all other consonant
intervals, and can also be doubled. It can appear as the resolution of
a preceding dissonance, as in Example 5. Since it is a consonance, it can
occur on a weak as well as a strong beat, and can progress upwards or
downwards to other notes without constraint. On the other hand, the
six-four chord in the second measure (+) of Example 4 is dissonant,
because the fifth can be sounded in place of the sixth, which displaces
the fifth and must resolve to it, while the fourth stands in place of the
third and must resolve to it. The real root of this dissonant six-four
chord is the bass note. Since the sixth as well as the fourth in this
chord are non-essential dissonances, they can neither be introduced
freely, nor be doubled. Nor can they occur other than on a strong beat,
but are subject to the same rules as all other non-essential dissonances.
The consonant six-four chord often occurs with the minor third
above the bass note, which is the essential seventh above the root, as in
Example 6. This third never occurs with the dissonant six-four chord.
Those who have a feeling for a correct progression of the fundamental
harmony need only pay attention to the fundamental bass in order to
distinguish the dissonant from the consonant six-four chord. And thus
an end would finally be put to the eternal dispute-whether the fourth
is consonant or dissonant, whether it is now a fourth or an eleventhabout which so many written wars have been waged with unspeakable
bitterness without anything having been settled.

9.

The distinction between the non-essential seventh, which is a displacement of either the octave or the sixth, and the essential seventh,
whose chord is the independent fundamental chord, can be understood
from the following:
The non-essential seventh that displaces the octave is always major
because it is the leading tone and resolves up by a half step to the
octave of the root, as in Example 7. For this reason the minor seventh
can never be a displacement of the octave, but only of the sixth. Thus
with every seventh chord, if the sixth is not sounded after the seventh
over the same bass, one must consider whether it could at least be
sounded in its place. Where this occurs, the seventh is non-essential and
is considered as a sixth with respect to the fundamental chord; but
where this is not possible, it is essential. See Examples 8a, b, c, d and e.
In all these examples the non-essential seventh replaces the sixth, which
can be sounded in its place and to which it resolves over the same bass
note. In addition to this non-essential seventh, the essential seventh,
namely F, also occurs in the last three examples. No other interval can
be sounded either in its place or sounded after it above the same bass
note; rather it requires an entirely different harmony for its resolution.
The two sevenths differ most clearly in this respect; furthermore, the
fundamental harmony implied by each is so obvious that one can
hardly miss it.
10.
It was noted above that non-essential dissonances resolve most
naturally over the same bass note; but their resolution can also be
delayed until a subsequent harmony, thereby appearing as if they were
essential. [See Example 9.] Such delays of resolution cannot bring
about any change in the fundamental harmony. Considering what has
been said about the characteristics of non-essential dissonances, it can
readily be seen that in the first example the fourth stands in place of the
third, in the second example the ninth stands in place of the octave, and
in the third and fourth examples the seventh stands in place of the
sixth. They are suspensions whose resolution, instead of occurring over
the same bass note, is delayed until the following harmony. Thus in the
first three examples the fundamental harmony is the C major triad, and
in the last it is the essential seventh chord on G. Regarding the seventh,
which in such cases could cause some difficulty, one must carefully
consider whether the sixth could be sounded in its place, as was already
demonstrated in the preceding paragraph. We note in this case that such
delayed resolutions of non-essential dissonances cannot occur on a
subsequent harmony unless this harmony is compatible with the note to
which the resolution occurs.

11.
When the ninth is added to the essential seventh chord as a displacement of the octave, and its resolution is delayed until the following
harmony, as in Examples 10a [major] and 10b [minor], there remains,
after removal of the bass note, a seventh chord which could mislead
some to consider it as an independent fundamental chord, since it is
composed of a third, fifth, and seventh as is the essential seventh chord,
and is capable of the same inversions. In fact, some theorists have
chosen to attribute characteristics of a fundamental chord to the
diminished seventh chord in particular [Example 11], and have even
declared it to be one, but without cause. (Because of its perfect proportions of superimposed minor thirds, it is agreeable to the.ear and easy
to comprehend. Thus it is not always prepared by harmonists, as are
the other dissonances, but is introduced freely and not resolved until
the following harmony.) Other theorists, who have realized the
inadequacy of this interpretation, have established the third below the
bass note of this chord as the root; yet they have erred in a different
way, namely by considering it as a fundamental chord and as an
independent nine-seven chord. Both interpretations are wrong. Only
one thing need be mentioned: In the former case the seventh can
proceed to the sixth over the same bass note without detriment to the
harmony; indeed the sixth can be sounded in its place. In the latter case
the situation is the same for the ninth, in whose place the octave can be
heard. But this is contrary to the nature of a fundamental chord, which
must be so constituted that no essential change of its intervals-where
one interval can replace another-is possible. According to our stated
definition of non-essential dissonances and the delay of their resolution
until the following harmony, it follows quite naturally that this
seventh chord (be it diminished or not), which we choose to call
unauthentic to distinguish it from the essential fundamental chord, is
indeed a nine-seven chord above the root, that is, a nine-seven chord
above the tone a third below the bass note. However, since the ninth is a
non-essential dissonance and merely a displacement of the octave, whose
resolution is delayed until the following harmony, it could be nothing
other than our essential seventh chord. It is that and nothing else. This
can be seen clearly from Examples 12a and 12b. The treatment of this
unauthentic seventh chord becomes immediately apparent when the
non-essential seventh preceding the sixth is removed, leaving the six-five
chord as first inversion of the essential seventh chord. Since the bass
note of the six-five chord leads most naturally by step to the triad or its
inversions, the authentic seventh chord must also progress in the same
manner, a fact that is confirmed by experience. However, this progression is not at all natural to the essential seventh chord. Thus the seventh
chords in Example 13 are not unauthentic, and [each] is based on

the essential seventh chord whose root is a third below the bass note. In
the last example the essential seventh chord follows the unauthentic
one. The bass progression of the former is entirely different from the
latter, and thus cannot in any way be confused with it.
12.
The same also applies to the inversions of the unauthentic seventh
chord; its progressions are entirely different from those of the essential
seventh chord. Thus, if the previously given explanation is also applied
to the inversions of this seventh chord, one could not miss the true
fundamental harmony in Example 14. It can easily be seen that in each
chord marked with an asterisk the non-essential ninth displaces the
octave, and that all these chords are inversions of the unauthentic
seventh chord. If they were inversions of the essential seventh chord,
they would have to have an entirely different progression, as is evident
from Example 15.
13.
For anyone capable of distinguishing between a natural and an
unnatural harmonic progression-and this is assumed in the case of
those who want to have a thorough understanding of the reduction of
all chords to their true fundamental chords-it will be an easy matter
after these explanations to understand precisely the treatment of the
different seventh chords and to identify their correct fundamental
chords just by paying attention to the preceding as well as the following
harmony. Otherwise it will not always be possible to know whether the
seventh is essential or non-essential, and whether or not the sixth could
be sounded in its place. Every seventh chord that leads to a subsequent
harmony is either the fundamental harmony itself or is based on the
essential seventh chord whose root is a third below the bass note. The
diminished seventh chord cannot possibly be interpreted in two different
ways; since its seventh always displaces the sixth, it is always based on
the third below the bass note. The same is true of the inversions of this
chord, which are most clearly distinguishable from all other inversions
of seventh chords, and cannot cause the slightest difficulty in identifying
their fundamental harmony. However, either of these fundamental
harmonies can apply to the seventh chord in Example 16. But if we
consider the preceding harmony, as given in Example 17a or 17b, we can
see that in the first case the seventh displaces the sixth and its resolution
is delayed until the following harmony; consequently it is based on the
third below the bass note, that is, on C with its triad. In the other case
the seventh is essential and the chord itself is the fundamental harmony.
Another situation where the seventh chord can be either essential or
unauthentic is given in Example 18. If we now consider the following
harmony, as given in Example 19a or 19b, we recognize without

difficulty that the seventhis essentialin the first case, but non-essential
in the other. Thus the diminishedtriad on B in the first example and
the major triad on G in the second would have to be doubled in a fullvoiced texture, since they are the fundamentalharmoniesof the two
seventh chords. Likewise, we recognize the inversions of the seventh
chords from the precedingor following harmony, and determinetheir
true fundamentalchords.
14.
Since the essential seventh chord on the dominant of a tonic is the
most perfect dissonant chord (see paragraph and therefore just as
4)
comprehensibleto the ear as the triad, its seventh need not always be
prepared;it can be introduced freely, even when the octave is not
contained in the precedingchord. However,in the latter situation, care
must be taken that both intervalsare not heardnext to one anotheras
a second, since the chord therebyloses clarity. Thus, in the arrangement
of all dissonantchords,especiallywhen there aremany voices, the main
concern is a fitting distribution of the intervals so that they sound
comprehensible to the ear. Every dissonant chord can be considered
with respect to the dissonant relationshipof its tones to the fundamental harmony, and with respect to the consonant or dissonantrelationship of its constituent intervals.The more dissonancesthere arein
relation to the fundamentalharmony, the more necessaryit is that the
intervals be consonant in relation to each other. Wherethis is not the
that each can be heard
case, the dissonancesmust at least be so arranged
for itself; that is, they must be widely separatedand not closer to one
another than a minor third. A chord is most intelligible if it can be
arrangedin such a fashion that every interval is consonant with its
neighbor.However,it becomesless intelligiblewhen seconds are next to
one another in its arrangement; more and the closer these seconds
the
are to each other, the less intelligibleis the chord. Thereforeeven the
non-essentialninth, when it is combined with the essential seventh of
the dominant,can be introducedwithout preparation the consonantly
in
arrangedposition shown in Example 20. And it is often better understood than the octave itself, if the octave forms a second with the
seventh, as in Example 21. For this reasonmany dissonantchordshave
either no inversions whatsoever, or only a few that are permissible,
dependingon the greateror lesser number of dissonancesthey contain
that cannot be combined as consonances. For the same reason the
over the same bass
[soprano] positions of a chord or its arrangements
are not of equal quality, but are either more comprehensible useful
and
or less intelligible and of no use. Generally chords that have a nonessential dissonancein the bass are least useful. In this case the intervals
that are consonant in relation to the fundamental bass become
185

dissonancesin relation to the bass note, and these dissonancesproceed
without resolution. Two dissonancesare contained in the previously
mentioned nine-sevenchord, namely the essentialseventh and the nonessential ninth. In addition, there are three dissonant seconds in this
chord, namely from the seventh to the octave, the octave to the ninth,
and the ninth to the tenth or third. Nevertheless,the chord soundsvery
intelligible in the above-mentionedposition because the intervals are
distributed in superimposedminor thirds only. However, this same
chord is less intelligiblein the positions shown in Example22, since, in
additionto the above-mentioned
dissonances,a second is heard, whereby
too muchis demandedof the ear. If this second is furtherseparatedby a
half tone, as in Example 23, then the chord becomes far more comprehensible.If we invert the nine-sevenchord, the four chordsshown in
Example 24 result. They are unintelligible,at least in these positions,
and of these the last is least useful becausethe non-essentialdissonance
is situated in the bass. But if the intervalsof the first three inversions
are distributedconsonantly amongstthemselves,or at least by a certain
distance,as in Example25, they become more comprehensible.
Since no chord can contain any more than four dissonances, the
fundamentalharmony is doubled in the lower partsin all chordshaving
more voices. [See Example 26.] This is generally the case in all
multivoicedchords,even when they do not contain all four dissonances.
[See Example 27.] From the preceding,it can be seen how necessaryit
is to know the fundamentalharmony of every chord. Otherwise we
would not know which intervals would have to be doubled in multivoiced chords, and the risk of doubling dissonances instead of
consonances would arise. Thus, not only could forbidden and unintelligible progressionsarise, but also chords entirely different from those
intended and requiredby the progression.
15.

Now that we have defined the most essentialfeaturesconcerningthe
recognition and treatment of fundamentalharmonies and the chords
arising from them, it is necessary to give a sufficient explanation of a
few unusual chords that appear to be related to neither of our
fundamentalchords, and of certainharmoniclicenses.
The chord of the augmented sixth, which is combined with the
major third and augmentedfourth [Example28], is apparentlyneither
an inversionof the triadnor of the essentialseventhchord. Then what is
it? It is really nothing other than the dissonantfour-threechord that
arises from the second inversion of the third essential seventh chord
(see paragraph1). One need only review the origin and treatment of
this chord to be convinced of this. When the older composers wanted
to make a half cadence on the dominant of the tonic in a minor key,

they used the natural four-threechord as a suitable leading chord to
such a cadence [Example 29a], or without the fourth [Example29b],
which is really the same chord. If they wanted to make the cadence
more striking,they would raisethe sixth by a half step and put D-sharp
in place of D, thereby making the E chord more necessary and the
cadence more sensible. But to avoid a certain mi-fa, which arisesfrom
inversion of the diminished third D-sharp-F,and which was generally
forbidden,they raisedthe bassnote by a half step at the same time, and
put F-sharpin place of F, as in Example30a or 30b. [This procedure]
resulted in another natural four-three chord, which comes from the
inversion of the first essential seventh chord. Moderncomposershave
sought to retain the strikingquality of this last cadence;but since the
F-sharpin the bass is foreign to the key of A minor and sounds harsh,
F instead of F-sharpwas deemedmore natural(in spite of the forbidden
mi-fa), and the augmented sixth was introduced as in Example 31.
the
Thus the minor key was better characterized, following chord was
made more necessaryand the cadence was made smoother. This is the
origin of the augmented sixth. Since it is merely a decoration transferred from the melody to the harmony and stands in place of the
customary major sixth, which can always be sounded in its place, the
augmented sixth can neither effect a change in the fundamental
harmony nor much less form an independent fundamentalchord, as
some have incorrectly taught. Thereforethe augmentedsixth chord is
always based on our third essential seventhchord, whose root is a fifth
below the bassnote, as shown in Example32. And if the fifth instead of
the fourth is used in this chord, the fifth is the non-essentialninth from
bass. This ninth either resolvesover the same bassor its
the fundamental
resolution is delayed until the following harmony, whereit goes to the
fifth.
in
This augmented sixth chord should not be arranged such a way
that the diminishedthird resultingfrom inversionis formed by adjacent
notes, since this third cannot be well understoodeven when separated

by a distanceof one or two octaves(see paragraph
16.
of
The characteristics the augmentedsixth chord are similarto those
of the triad with the augmentedfifth [Example 33] and its inversions
[Example 34]. This augmentedfifth from the fundamentaltone is no
more essentialto the chord than the augmentedsixth; it is, as the latter,
a mere decoration that is used to make the following note, to which it
wants to progress,necessaryand sensible.However,since the customary
perfect fifth can just as well be used in its place, and the progression
can be exactly the same to the followingnote as well as to the following
chord, the fundamentalharmony also remainsexactly the same as it

17.
We are indebted to the modem composersfor the appearance yet
of
another chord. Presumablyit must flatter the fine ears of our gallant
composersgreatly, since it appearsseveraltimes on most every page of
their compositions; yet they might have difficulty giving a sufficient
reason for it. This chord consists of a diminishedoctave, minor sixth
and minor third, and is used primarilyas an introduction to a half
cadence on the dominant of the principal key, as in Example 35a or
35b.
The extent to which simple melodic ornaments such as the
appoggiatura have been abused in the works of the more recent
was used by the older
composers is ridiculous. When an appoggiatura
teachersof composition, it always precededan intervalconsonant with
the root of the chord, so that the ear, which would have been shocked
by the suddenness of an unprepareddissonance, would be satisfied
shortly thereafter.The more moderncomposers,whose ears apparently
are not so easily shocked, have noticed first of all that in certain
situations, dissonances-particularly the essential seventh with the
dominantchord and the ninth when it is combinedwith this seventhsound quite agreeablewhen introduced freely. Then they have treated
these tones as if they were consonant by allowing them to be delayed
by others that were in turn treated as freely introducedappoggiaturas.
These appoggiaturaswere then interpreted as genuine chord-tones,
and
which were decorated with new appoggiaturas, so forth, until no
shadow of the fundamentalharmony remainedin the structureof the
chord. Who would not believe that this diminishedoctave chord was
meant to be heard simultaneouslyas the majorand minor triadson the
third below the bass note? And yet the diminishedoctave and sixth as
preparedin Example 35 can still be understoodas mere suspensionsor
precedingthe seventhand fifth, as shown in Example36.
appoggiaturas
And the fundamentalbass, which is not affected by such ornaments,
must be understoodfrom the followingharmony;thus the fundamental
bass of the given example must, of course,be as shown in Example37.
From this the treatment of the diminishedoctave and sixth chord
becomes obvious; that is, since both these intervalsare suspensions
preceding dissonanceswhich can be introduced freely, they should be
preparedand contained in the precedingchord. However, when these
suspensions are written without any preparation in our modern

is in turn delayed by other appoggiaturas[Example 39], which are
sometimes preparedas little as shown in Example 40a or even as in
Example 40b, then these gentlemen may assume the responsibility
themselves.We cannot justify the style of the unmusicalforeignersand
those who have modeled themselvesafter them. Meanwhilelet us stick
with the essential seventh chord on the third below the bass note in
such passages. Those who are not satisfied with this fundamental
bass may request a different one from the inventors of such delicacies
or may manufactureone by themselves.Harmonyprofits and forfeits
nothing thereby.
18.
In harmony there are passing chords that are not based on any
fundamentalharmony. They are to be consideredin the same manner
as melodic passing notes, from which they arise when various voices
in
progress a passingfashion. In Example41, the second bass note (D) is
a simple melodic passingnote in relation to the chord above it. However, a passingchord is formed above this D when one or more voices
of the precedingchord progresssimultaneouslywith it, as in Examples
42a, b, and c. Thus passing chords are intermediatechords that are
formed by the stepwise and mostly consonant progressionof one or
more voices from the preceding to the following fundamentalchord.
They always stand between two fundamentalchords that are either the
same or at least follow one another very naturally. Therefore they
can occur only on weak beats, because every chord stated on a strong
beat is necessarily felt as a fundamentalchord. Passingchords can be
further recognized by their unnatural harmonic progressions. These
progressions are unnatural either because some dissonance is left
unresolved or because the passing chords, even when they appear as
regularly treated fundamental chords, would neverthelessinhibit the
naturalprogressionof the fundamentalharmony. Illustrationsof these
chordsare givenin Example43.
The French use this last progressionat half cadences in the way
shown in Examples44a [minor] and 44b [major]. They have formed
an independent fundamental chord from this passing six-five chord,
whose sixth they call "la sixte ajoutee." This is wrong, since in
cadences of this kind, the sixth, like all other passingintervals,always
falls on the weak beat of the measurebetween two fundamentalchords
that follow one another naturally. For this reason it cannot be considered other than passing;it serves merely to make the half cadence
on the dominant somewhat more striking.Werethis sixth not passing,
the chords in Example 45, which are formed in the same way, would
also have to be consideredas so many fundamentalchords, wherebythe

system of harmony would become so mottled that eventuallyit would
no longer be recognizable.For this reason passingchords of this kind
are not always indicated by figures in the thorough-bass,especially
when the motion is rather fast. It can easily be seen that the French
six-five chord arises from the first inversion of the passing seventh
chord. If it wereto be acceptedas a fundamentalchord, the latter would
arise from the former, which is surely as nonsensicalas if one were to
maintain that cause results from effect. When a chord is definitely
expected in the context of a piece, as for example at cadences,greater
harmonists use far strangerintermediatechords to make the expected
harmony all the more striking.However,these intermediatechordsare
all passing. [See Example 46.] There are examples, of course, where
the six-five chord even falls on the strong beat of the measure and
progresseswithout resolution. In this case the resolution is omitted, a
with respect to severaldissonant
phenomenonthat will be demonstrated
chordsin the following paragraph.
When considering the weak beat of the measure with regard to
passing chords, it remains to be noted that here we are talking in
general about the strong and weak parts of the metric unit. In alla
breve time, or when the unit is fairly long, passingchordscan even fall
on the downbeatof a measure,as in Example47. In this case the second
measureis the weak half of a rhythmicunit, just as the second half of a
measureis its weak part.
19.
Whengreatharmonistswant to expresssomethingintense or want to
startle the listener, they take the liberty of omitting the resolution of
the essential seventh completely. That is, the consonant chord which
would result from the resolution of this dissonanceis omitted, and
another dissonantchord, which should have followed the omitted one
and whose dissonancewould have been preparedby it, is immediately
taken in its place. Thusinstead of the progression Example48 and its
in
inversions, those in Example 49 often occur. The resolution of the
essential seventh is omitted in all the latter progressions[Example49],
and the fundamentalharmony [Example 50] is to be understoodas in
the former [Example48].
The situationis similarin Example51, althoughthe chords sounding
in place of the omitted ones are consonant rather than dissonant.
Example 51-1 ought to have been as shown in Example 52, but the
second chord has been omitted. In Example 51-2 the six-five chord,
which Rameau and his disciples are determined to consider as a
fundamentalchord, is placed on a strong beat and progresseswithout
resolution. When this occurs, it is clear that the resolution has been
omitted, and the example is to be understoodas shown in Example 53.

first two chords can follow one another?Or does one not feel rather
that the resolutionhas been omitted between the first two chords,and
that the harmonicsuccessionmust be understoodas shown in Example
56?
How would the chord de la sixte ajoutee appearif Example54 were
written as in Example 57, which would not be at all unusual?Here,
where F-sharpis in the bass, it is impossible to conceive of the six-five
chord on F as the fundamentalharmony. And yet Rameau'sdisciples
want to know of no other fundamentalbass. Perhapsthey might raise
their root by a half step and give the fundamental
harmonythe progression shown in Example58. But that would be too awful. However,such
become easily intelligibleif one follows the straightforward
progressions
path which nature always provides,and if one considersthe following:
that the six-five chord is an inversionof the seventh chord;that in the
is
given example its most naturalprogression to the triadon G followed
the triadon C; and that the composer,for the sake of expressionand
by
voice-leading,omits the first triad and allows the following one to be
heard in its place. This is also the case with several [other] chords,
whose omission does not interfere with the naturalprogression;
they
can indeed astonish but not trouble the listener.And how unnecessary
it is to burden the system of harmony, which rests on such simple
simply to appearscholarly
pillars,with so many grotesqueextravagances
feeble thinkers and even to be considered the inventor of
among
harmony. The system of harmony was understoodand discoveredlong
before this, but was not distortedto such an extent.
Surelyno depth of harmonywas hidden from the elder Bach. He had
command of all harmonic possibilities and, more important than all
else, has brought them all into practice. No theorist, with all his
speculations, is capable of producing anything new after him. Yet all
of Bach'scompositions,even though some may initially appearintricate,
can be reduced to a naturalprogressionof the fundamentalbassand to
two simple fundamental chords, the triad and the essential seventh
chord. Examinationof his doublingswill reveal that he has neverused
any other chord as fundamental.If this man were still alive, who would
be able to tell him that he had composed haphazardly,that harmony
had been discovered or at least been put in order after him, that a

six-five chord, an augmentedsixth chord, a diminishedseventh chord,
an eleventh-, thirteenth-, and Apollo only knows how many more
chords existed that were not inversionsof other chords?The discovery
of these chords was attributedto a recent Frenchman,whose practical
compositions are, by the way, more faulty than correct and reveal far
less knowledge and understandingof harmony than the compositions
of his superior predecessorsand contemporariesof his own as well as
other nations. -But let us returnto our material.
It is evident from Examples 51-3 and 51-4 that several dissonant
chords-when they remainwithout resolutionand arepassingchordson
a weak beat, or on a strong beat where they must be fundamental
harmonies-can be understoodonly by assumingan omission of resolution. In Example 51-3 the sixth chord on A could not follow from the
precedingchord in a naturalway if the triadon C were not understood
as being omitted. Similarly in Example 51-4 the resolution of the
seventh above the second bass note, which would normallylead to the
essential seventh chord on G, has been omitted. Even the resolutionof
the non-essentialninth, when it is joined with the essentialseventh,can
be omitted, as is to be noted from the enharmonic progression in
Example 59, which is really to be understoodas shown in Example60.
However, the chord of resolution has been omitted and the following
one sounded immediatelyin its place. Except in the case of this ninth,
which is joined with the essential seventh, the resolution of nonessential dissonancescan never be omitted. Thus if one encountersan
unresolved fourth above the bass note in the works of good composers, this fourth is not the non-essentialdissonancethat displacesthe
third; it is either the consonant fourth or the thirdof the fundamental
seventhchord, as in the four-twochord.
20.
It is not necessary to explain here what is meant by anticipation,
retardationand transferof resolution;nor is it necessaryto explain that
they cannot produce any change in the fundamentalharmony. Yet it
deserves to be noted here that the familiar ascendingor descending
sixth progression [Example 61] is based solely on anticipation and
retardation;otherwise it could not be justified. These stepwise consecutivesixth chordscannot possibly be so many inversionsof the triad.
How could the C major, D minor, E minor triads,etc., which are not
at all capable of such close association, occur in succession without
offending our ears? The analysis of the succession of sixth chords in
Example 62 shows that they are not really sixth chords; ratherthey
result from anticipations in the top voice, and are founded on
fundamentalharmonies that follow one another very naturally.Or if
can
is
the progression as shownin Example63, the retardations also be in
the lowervoices, as is evident from the analysisprovidedin Example64.

Example 65 and similar ones also belong here. The sixth above the
second bass note is anticipated for the sake of good voice leading or for
other reasons. The seventh should occur in its place and the sixth
should follow directly afterwards, as in Example 66. Thus the fundamental bass of Examples 65 and 66 are to be understood in the same
way, namely as shown in Example 67.
Concerning transfer of resolution, we note that it occurs only in
connection with the essential seventh and its inversions. The resolution
of non-essential dissonances can neither be transferred nor omitted,
except in recitatives.
21.
A pedal point, which usually appears near the end of a fugal composition, is formed by a succession of harmonies sounding against a
sustained note in the bass, or in the soprano voice, or even (albeit
infrequently) in a middle voice. In determining the fundamental
harmony, the sustained note is disregarded when the harmonies are not
directly related to it; rather the fundamental harmony is derived from
the moving parts, which must always be composed as if the sustained
note were not there. A pedal point deviates from the chord of the sustained tone, which is either the tonic or the dominant (preferably the
latter), and returns to it gradually. If the return occurs at the right
moment, it compliments the ear greatly. However, since pedal point is
a liberty, care should be taken not to use any chords that would lead
too far from the goal and make the return difficult. Although the
familiar progressions in Examples 68a and 68b do not always occur just
in contrapuntal compositions, they are also to be considered as types of
pedal point. In Example 68a the departure from the harmony of the
sustained note occurs with the seven-four-two chord, and the return to
it occurs with the following chord. The same situation exists in Example
68b. Since the sustained note is not considered in such cases, the
fundamental harmony of the first is that shown in Example 69, and
that of the second in Example 70.
The passages in Example 71a and 71b should not be confused with
pedal point. Here the sustained voices, which are in the majority,
indicate the fundamental harmony against which the bass is heard in
ascending or descending scales. This is really nothing other than the
permissible passage shown in Example 72, which can be embellished
and prolonged as is fitting.

22.
These are the principles by which everything that is written in the
strict style, no matter how enigmatical it may first appear or sound, can
be reduced to the two fundamental chords that are the foundation of
all harmony. Now the questions are: Which progressions are proper to

the fundamental bass? Or which fundamental harmonies can follow one
another naturally? To answer these questions correctly would require
that every triad and essential seventh chord in a given key be considered
separately, that the possibility of each and every progression of these
chords be indicated, and that the reason why each of these progressions
is or is not possible be stated. This would be too detailed for our
purpose. Thus we are content, since it is best for beginners, to touch
upon only the most natural and most common progressions of the
fundamental bass.
These are, first of all, those in fourths and fifths [Examples 73 and
74]; secondly those in sixths or descending thirds [Example 75];
thirdly, those in seconds, but seldom different from the situation shown
in Example 76.
The fundamental bass often appears to progress by step even when
this is not really the case, as in Example 77. These chords all appear to
be traids, and the bass line of the example, which progresses by step
from the second to the third chord, seems to be the fundamental
bass. But the second chord permits the addition of the sixth, and thus
is not a fundamental chord but a six-five chord whose root is a third
below the bass note. This invalidates the stepwise progression. One
must pay close attention to this, since the fundamental harmony is
also changed when an interval not present in the chord can be sounded
after it, as in Example 78. Thus the fundamental bass of this example is
not as shown in Example 79a, but more correctly as shown in Example
79b.
Only when the change of harmony occurs too suddenly and the
intention of the composer is to startle the listener with an unexpected
progression, as in Example 80a or 80b, should the sixth not be sounded
after the A chord in the first example, which is delayed by the nonessential sixth. However, the sixth could be sounded in its place under
different circumstances. The fundamental bass of this example, which is
shown in Example 81, is to be preferred to the one shown in Example
82, since it is more in accord with the intention [of the composer],
and in this case is more natural. The same fundamental bass applies
all the more to Example 80b, since the F-sharp chord makes even
less sense when the seventh is added to the A chord. In such
cases stepwise progression of the fundamental bass can certainly
occur.
All possible remaining progressions more or less exceed the ordinary,
and are thus bound by many kinds of conditions. To discuss all of these
conditions here would far exceed the intention of this work. Those
who study the works of great harmonists diligently and pay attention
to the succession of the fundamental chords, will easily perceive the
extraordinary progressions of the fundamental bass according to our

23.
The following fugue by Johann Sebastian Bach, which to this day
has appearedinsoluble even to greatmen of our time, is publishedhere
together with our analysis of its fundamentalchords as proof of our
stated principles [see Appendix A]. We believe that our reasoningis
based on the nature of the matter itself when we state that these
principles of harmony are not only the true ones, but also the only
ones by which this fugue may be explained, and by which all apparent
difficulties in the other works of this greatestharmonistof all times3
Conversely,we maintainthat
may be solved and made comprehensible.
all music which cannot be reduced to a natural progressionof both
fundamentalchords according to our principlesis composed unintelligibly,hence incorrectlyandcontraryto the strict style of composition.
SUPPLEMENT
The rule that one must pay close attention to the progression of

each chord cannot be repeatedtoo often, since a chord is often entirely
different than it appearsto be as a result of its progression.In orderto
please the less experienced, we are adding the following examples
[Table III] of different progressionswith their fundamentalchords.
Their explanation is already obvious from the preceding.Nevertheless
these progressionscould be puzzling to some who have not graspedthe
theory of fundamentalchords completely or to those who still lack the
feeling for a natural progression.Such individualscould be misled in
findingthe correct fundamentalbass.
In the last example the tenor is a pedal point. (See Paragraph
21.)
Since we are concerned here only with the less experienced, to
whom the harmonic arts are not yet so familiar that they would
completely understand the reduction of the preceding fugue to its
fundamentalchords, we believe to renderthem an agreeableserviceby
addingan easierpreludeby the same composertogetherwith an analysis
of the first part [see Appendix B]. We have omitted the fundamental
bass from the second part, which is not much more difficult than the
first, to give each an opportunity to analyze it on his own.4 Only two
kinds of progressionswhich occur frequently in this prelude merit
attention: (1) One could imagine hearing an F chord on the second
eighth note of the first measure;however, since this chord progresses
to the E majorchord on the third eighth note, one realizesthat it is not
an F chord, but a D chord with the essentialseventh.(2) Similarly,one
could imagine hearing the dominant seventh chord of A on the first
eighth note of the third measure;however, since this chord must be

interpretedin relation to the last eighth note of the precedingmeasure,
which progressesnaturally to the tonic triad at the beginning of the
following measure,it is not to be understoodas the seventh chord on
E, but as the suspended six-four chord on E, whose root is a fifth
below the bass note. From this it also becomes clear that Bachindeed
understood the distinction between the consonant and the dissonant
six-four chords; while the former is used freely in Bach's works, the
latter is never found without preparation.(See Paragraph wherethe

NOTES
1. Proof of this is as follows: The first seventh chord, which is formed
above the dominant, prepares the tonic triad to which it leads
directly, thereby effecting a complete rest.

1\'o I" II

The second seventh chord is less perfect because it cannot lead
directly to the tonic triad, but first must go to its dominant. Yet it
leads to a major cadence,
7 7
and is therefore more perfect than the third seventh chord, which
leads in the same manner to a minor cadence:

The fourth seventh chord requires still one more progression before
7 7
coming to rest,

and is therefore the least perfect of all.
2. The most perfect harmonic cadence occurs withl:?

least

of all, because the seventh from the fundamental, which in a second
chord is in the bass and must move down by step, resolves to the third
of the chord rather than to the tonic note itself; and since the tonic
must be in the bass at a cadence, no close can be achieved.
3. Anyone who is a connoisseur of the art will hardly find this praise
exaggerated. If one takes into consideration the astonishing skill of
this man on the clavier as well as on the organ, his admirably learned
manner of improvising in many voices, and the quantity of his works
which have come down to us and which are all models of the art, then
one must look down with pity upon the [following] distorted
judgment of a critic who is very poorly versed in music. On p. 174 of
the twenty-second volume of the Jenaische Zeitung von gelehrten
Sachen, this critic does not hesitate to say that the fine passage by
Gesner-who takes occasion in a remark on p. 61 of his new edition of
Quintilian to do full justice to the merits of the late Bach-suits
Vogler as well and perhaps even better than the old Johann Sebastian
Bach, etc. If one now asks, "Who is this Vogler?", one finally learns
after many inquiries that he is burgomaster and organist in Weimar
and a pupil of Bach. But he was by no means even one of his best
pupils. [Johann Matthias Gesner (1691-?) was Rector of the ThomasSchule in Leipzig from 1730 to 1734. His edition of Quintilian was
published in 1738. John Casper Vogler (1696-1763), who studied
224

with Bach at Arnstadt and Weimar, was Bach's second successor as
organist at Weimar.]
