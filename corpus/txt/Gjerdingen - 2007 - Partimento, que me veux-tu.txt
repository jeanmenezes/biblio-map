Partimento, que me veux-tu?
Robert O. Gjerdingen

Abstract	 Jean-Jacques Rousseau, eighteenth-century French author and philosopher, was first a musician.
As a youth he had been unable to find a qualified music master and hence lacked the training required to excel
in his chosen field. He did read carefully the harmony treatise of Jean-Philippe Rameau, but that study neither
advanced his compositional abilities nor later shielded him from the scorn of Rameau himself. Had Rousseau
found a master of the then fashionable Italian style of music, he would have studied exercises in partimenti and
solfeggi. Solfeggi were studies for voice with bass accompaniment. Partimenti were instructional basses from
which an apprentice was expected to re-create complete compositions at the keyboard. The prodigious mental
powers developed through the study of partimenti, which greatly facilitated improvisation and composition, gave
a competitive advantage to composers so trained. Though an old, nonverbal method of craft instruction, partimenti
were nonetheless a cognitively optimal means of developing fluency in a complex, multivoice style of music. In
memorizing exemplars of small contrapuntal schemata, fitting them to the matching locations in a partimento,
and then realizing them in a current style, the apprentice was training himself to think in “free” counterpoint.

the title of this essay echoes a remark—“Sonate, que me veux-tu?” (Sonata,
what do you want of me?)—quoted by Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1728–78) at the
close of his encyclopedia article “Sonate” (1765). As summarized by Peter
Walls (2004), the remark “was supposedly a cry of exasperation uttered by
Bernard de Fontenelle (1657–1757) at a concert consisting entirely of instrumental music which (lacking a text) seemed to the philosopher devoid of
semiotic clues” (Rousseau: “Je n’oublierai jamais le mot du célèbre M. de Fontenelle, qui se trouvant à un concert, excédé de cette symphonie éternelle,
s’écria tout haut dans un transport d’impatience, sonate, que me veux-​ u?”). If
t
e
­ ighteenth-century literati like Fontenelle wondered how one ought to
engage with a semantically unconstrained instrumental composition, what
would they have made of a partimento? At least sonatas merited publication
and the appellation opus. Partimenti, unpublished, untitled, and known primarily to professionals trained in hereditary musician families or in orphanagec
­ onservatories, provided but the single thread of one part (usually a bass)
from which the student was expected to re-create a self-standing piece of
music. The given thread—il filo (Leopold Mozart 1778)—meant that a partimento was not free, not a mode of fantasia, yet the phantom nature of the
other parts, especially the lack of a notated melody, meant that a partimento
was not quite a composition, not quite a work. There was to be no entry in the
Encyclopédie for “Partimento.”

The quote from Fontenelle served to bolster Rousseau’s argument that
instrumental music could achieve little more than pleasant artifice when cut
off from the “soul and energy” of the human voice (1765; “Qui ne sent combien la musique instrumentale est éloignée de cette âme & de cette énergie?”). Rousseau, often mentioned as a godfather to Romanticism, advocated
a “natural” art freed from artifice. That the greatest compositional triumph of
this almost-modern man, his chamber opera Le devin du village (1752), would
premiere to acclaim in the exquisitely artificial environment of the royal château at Fontainebleu is but one of many ironies in his life. His spotty musical
training made him little more than a gifted amateur, but he wrote many of the
music entries for the Encyclopédie. Rousseau’s apprenticeship was in engraving,
but he often made his living copying music. Master of no existing genre of
music, he invented a new one, melodrama (Pygmalion, 1770). A central figure
in Parisian cultural circles and later interred in the Panthéon as a national
hero, he was always a foreigner, a “citizen of Geneva” who would declare himself a partisan of Italian music.
Rousseau was aware of these contradictions, being at times acutely
embarrassed when his various selves could not be reconciled. After a failed
attempt to impress the Parisian Academy of Science with a new scheme for
thoroughbass ciphers—the Academy yawned—he remained in the city, hoping somehow to make his fortune. At the moment when he was down to his last
sou he received the following advice from a friendly priest: “Since musicians
and the learned do not sing by your scale [i.e., the new system of notation],
change the string, and apply to the women. You will perhaps succeed better
with them” (Rousseau 1769, bk. 7). The priest had mentioned Rousseau to a
Madam de Beuzenval and urged the young Genevan to pursue this connection. In his Confessions Rousseau describes what happened:
I at length took courage, and called upon Madam de Beuzenval. She received
me with kindness; and Madam de Broglie entering the chamber, she said to
her: “Daughter, this is M. Rousseau, of whom Father Castel has spoken to us.”
Madam de Broglie complimented me upon my work, and going to her harpsichord proved to me she had already given it some attention. Perceiving it to be
about one o’clock, I prepared to take my leave. Madam de Beuzenval said to me:
“You are at a great distance from the quarter of the town in which you reside;
stay and dine here.” I did not want asking a second time. A quarter of an hour
afterwards, I understood, by a word, that the dinner to which she had invited
me was that of her servants’ hall. (Rousseau 1769, bk. 7)

The aristocrat, Madam de Beuzenval, took it for granted that a musician was
an artisan, a craftsman, and thus someone on the level of her skilled servants.
Rousseau, who had never apprenticed in music, thought of his art as more
akin to philosophy. He was mortified suddenly to see himself as this noblewoman saw him. A professional musician like Haydn, for instance, would have
known that in courtly society an artiste, however successful, was no more than

Robert O. Gjerdingen 

  Partimento, que me veux-tu?

the highest form of artisan. Haydn’s contract clearly spelled out that he would
“board at the officer’s table.” Moreover he should not fraternize with the regular musicians: “The said Joseph Heyden shall abstain from undue familiarity,
from eating and drinking and other intercourse with them, so as to maintain the respect due to him and preserve it” (Geiringer and Geiringer 1982,
44–45). So it ought to have been obvious that while a Parisian noblewoman
might chat with her gardener, listen to suggestions from her dressmaker, even
argue with her music master, she would not expect to break bread with any of
them. To do so would be to ignore the distinctions of rank and “the respect
due.”
As a philosophe contemplating the art of musical artisans, Rousseau
observed and wrote about many things that professional musicians likely
considered self-evident. For that reason, his Dictionnaire de musique (Rousseau
1768) proves a valuable resource today, when much that was second nature
in the 1760s is no longer so. But his outsider’s perspective could also be a
weakness when it came to describing the core competencies of the insiders.
Thoroughbass, or what the French called accompagnement, was one such competence. Here is the beginning of Rousseau’s discussion of “accompanying” at
the harpsichord, from a contemporary English translation of his Dictionnaire:
There is given, as a direction, one of the parts of music, which is ordinarily the
bass. That bass must be touched with the left-hand, and with the right the harmony expressed by the tone of the bass, by the melody of the other parts, which
are playing at the same time, by the partition which is placed before the eyes,
or by the cyphers which are found added to the bass. The Italians hold the
cyphers in contempt, the partition itself is of little service to them; the quickness and nicety of the ear supplies their place, and they accompany extremely
well without all this preparation, but it is to their natural disposition alone that
they are indebted for this facility and another people, not born to music like
themselves, find in the execution of the accompanying, several difficulties
almost insurmountable. Eight or ten years are necessary for succeeding therein
in any tolerable degree. (Rousseau ca. 1775)

Had Rousseau been apprenticed at an early age to a demanding Italian maestro, he would have witnessed his fellow students, native Italians, working
equally as hard, with their “natural disposition” offering no exemption from
the years of practice needed to attain that “quickness and nicety of the ear.”
He would also have discovered the important means for eventually achieving
this fabled Italian “facility”: partimenti and solfeggi.
Outside Italy, the modern reappraisal of partimenti began in the 1930s
with Karl Gustav Fellerer (1902–84). Shortly after receiving his doctorate
(1925), he took up a post in Münster, where he encountered the huge holdings of Italian music manuscripts in the Santini collection. Fortunato Santini
(1778–1861), a Roman priest, tyro composer, and bibliophile, had amassed
one of Europe’s largest collections of music-pedagogical works from the
­ ighteenth- and early-nineteenth-century conservatories of Naples. Those
e

manuscripts formed the background for one of Fellerer’s early essays on partimenti (1934). Although his remarks were concerned with partimenti performed at the organ, they apply equally well to other keyboard instruments:
This practice of thoroughbass applies not only to the accompaniments of vocal
works, but also—a little known fact—to pieces for organ solo. The pieces transcribed in this manner went by the name of partimenti. They were particularly
widespread in Italy during the eighteenth century.
They were, on the one hand, exercises intended to introduce the student
organist to the reading of thoroughbass, which placed them principally among
textbooks. On the other hand, these sorts of pieces were intended for organists
to use in service playing, right alongside the many organ pieces completely written out by their composers. What is characteristic of this art is that improvisation assumes an importance equal to composition, with respect not only to
harmony but also to counterpoint. . . . 
Playing a partimento presupposes knowledge of the rules of the harmony, control of contrapuntal voices, and especially a presence of mind and
powers of concentration which make it possible, at a glance, to engage a complex fabric of voices and to envisage the possibilities of their development in
order to construct a whole that is securely balanced and structured. (Fellerer
1934, 251–54)

Fellerer’s work on partimenti came to an end during the Second World War.
Decades passed before there began a second wave of reappraisal motivated
by increasing interest in, and respect for, all forms of improvisation, by the
promulgation of editions containing important partimento manuscripts, and
by both pedagogical and psychological fascination with the legendary “presence of mind and powers of concentration” that could enable young apprentices to “engage a complex fabric of voices,” most of which were imaginary. In
North America, a dissertation on basso continuo by Tharald Borgir (1971) was
perhaps the first English-language publication to present an informed discussion of partimenti. A subsequent dissertation by Alexander Silbiger (1976),
“Italian Manuscript Sources of Seventeenth-Century Keyboard Music,” began
to draw attention to early Italian keyboard practices in general. In the 1990s
the pace of research accelerated. Thomas Christensen’s study of the “Rule
of the Octave” (1992), a collective term for a suite of rules detailing each
scale degree ascending and descending, described the importance of what was
often the first topic covered in a manuscript of partimenti. And the research by
Jesse Rosenberg (1995, 1999) on Pietro Raimondi (1786–1853) provided the
first historical conspectus in English of the partimento tradition, its sources,
and its legends. In Italy, a new generation of scholars had already begun to
reexamine the archival documents relating to partimento training. Rosa Cafiero (1993) described the teaching of partimenti by masters in the conservatories of Naples, and Giorgio Sanguinetti (1997) traced the continuity of
the partimento tradition in nineteenth- and twentieth-century Italian music
theory. More recently, the publication of the Langloz manuscript (Renwick

Robert O. Gjerdingen 

  Partimento, que me veux-tu?

2001) of partimento fugues from the circle of J. S. Bach has demonstrated the
widespread adoption of partimento practices. The sponsorship of the digital distribution of the central manuscripts of eighteenth-century partimenti
by the National Endowment for the Humanities has helped to promote free
access to this immense repertory (Gjerdingen 2005). And this author’s Music
in the Galant Style (2007) has endeavored to show how training in partimenti
was an ideal preparation for the highly schematized musical art favored in
eighteenth-century courts.
The present essay concentrates on the pedagogical and psychological
aspects of partimenti.
Training the artisan

Distinctions of rank had major consequences when it came to education. Only
someone of means and leisure could afford the following course of study recommended for English gentlemen (Anonymous ca. 1799), especially given
that it had almost no chance of resulting in significant musical competence:
As Gentlemen should be Scholars . . . , and not ignorant of such a valuable part
of learning, as the simple elements of plain Geometry, and practical Arithmetic, I would recommend them to read Doctor Holder’s treatise on the principles
of Harmony.—Mr. Stillingfleet’s remarks on Tartini’s work, and if they have no
objection to a little Greek, they may look into Ptolemy, published by Dr. Wallis,
or the five Greek writers on Music, by Meibomius. This is the study of Music
really as a science, and will much facilitate the knowledge of its Practice, especially as to Thorough-Bass, and the principles of composition.

In contrast to the above program for gentleman dilettantes, “the method
of training professional musicians was the craft system of education” (Kassler
1972, 217). A young boy would learn the rudiments from a local teacher before
beginning an apprenticeship with a music master. Sometimes this could all be
accomplished within the family, as with the Bachs or Mozarts. At other times
the apprenticeship would resemble the indenture of a servant, often for a
period of seven years. The apprenticeship could be quite formal, with a signed
contract, or it could be more informal, as when Haydn agreed to serve as valet
to the Neapolitan master Nicola Porpora (1686–1768) in return for lessons in
composition. Common to the teaching of all crafts was an emphasis on internalizing a set of preferred models or stock patterns:
The craft system of education fulfilled one fundamental requisite of educational theory: that the pupil form himself upon a model. The model was not
within the mind itself but was an external “form” which was to be imitated. In
so doing, the pupil learned a just representation of a thing, or person, imitated,
which afterwards could be deviated from by his making further searches from
his own “stock” or from the stock of others. Hence, the quality of education
under the craft system rested primarily upon the music master. (Kassler 1972,
218–19)

Figure 1.  The traditional European schema for drawing a three-dimensional face, shown in
three positions

The art historian E. H. Gombrich has written at length on the use of
schematic models in the traditional training of visual artists. By analogy to
an apprentice musician, he points to the importance of supervised practice:
“Just as the young singer lived in the house of his master and learned and
practiced scales for many years under his constant supervision, so the painter’s apprentice was delivered into the power of his taskmaster, who saw to it
that he spent hours in the exercise of copying the works of the great” (1956,
156–57). Much of the student’s copying was mundane, involving the internalization of the many models in specially prepared books or manuscripts. These
humble pattern books helped establish and maintain standard ways of drawing eyes, hands, familiar objects, and especially the human face. Gombrich
directs attention to “the most widespread and familiar of all the diagrammatic
formulas taught in the Western tradition—the divided oval or egg shape that
does duty for the head” (168; see Figure 1).
The images in Figure 1 were created by this author as computer-drawn
approximations of eighteenth-century copybook designs by J. D. Preissler
(Preissler and Taubert 1734), member of a large German artisan-family of
engravers. Note how adding the perceptual cues of faint eyes and a mouth
to the right-hand oval helps to communicate a much stronger illusion of a
human face (the other ovals are exact rotations of the same schema but lack
those cues). More to the point, the schema itself was not an image. It was a
framework on which to draw an image, a framework that helped the beginner
surmount the difficulties of representing a three-dimensional object viewed
from any angle.
Besides being a staple of four centuries of pattern books for apprentices,
this oval-with-cross schema appears in the sketches of such master artists as
Leonardo da Vinci, Fra Bartolommeo, Paolo Veronese, and Rembrandt:
In their drawings, the schema assumes the form of shorthand notations which
the artist will expand and fill in when the time comes. And yet, I think, when
we call such formulas “abbreviations” or “simplifications” we are not quite
doing justice to their psychological status. The artist need not think first of a

Robert O. Gjerdingen

real head which he then reduces to the abstract oval—even for him the oval,
the schema, is the starting point which he will then clothe with flesh and blood
if the occasion requires. (Gombrich 1956, 171)

The apprentice draftsman had to learn many component models—
eyes, ears, nose—that were to be incorporated within the larger model of
the face, which in turn was but a component of models for the standing or
seated human figure, which itself occupied a location and role within a conventional pictorial scene. Artisans involved in crafting temporal rather than
visual designs needed to master a similar hierarchy of patterns. An improvising actor of the commedia dell’arte, for example, needed to memorize the
jokes, banter, dialogues, soliloquies, and physical comedy for the stock character appropriate to his or her age and gender. The actor then needed to learn
how to connect those atoms of comedy into the molecules of scenes, which
would ultimately be integrated within the skeletal plot narratives known as
scenarios. These many patterns of speech, action, and reaction had to become
so second nature that the actor could adapt smoothly to the unpredictable
events of unscripted, often outdoor performance. For the training of beginning actors, the commedia dell’arte troupe kept a zibaldone, or commonplace
book, full of items for memorization. These were not printed books but private manuscripts containing many of the trade secrets of the craft.
In our era of copy machines and mass-produced textbooks, it can be
difficult to imagine the practical and symbolic importance of a hand-copied
notebook. Like a diary, it was a personal record of precepts learned and exercises studied. It might also contain models for emulation. Commonplace
books were to be found in all the arts. In Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice,
for instance, Mr. Bennet addresses Mary, the most studious of his five daughters, as follows: “What say you, Mary? for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know, and read great books, and make extracts” (vol. 1, ch. 2). In Italy,
the word zibaldone also applied to the extracts, exercises, rules, and models
to be found in a music student’s commonplace book (Galeazzi 1796, 54–55).
Though the most scholarly attention has focused on the zibaldoni of students
who studied with Bach, Handel, and Mozart (e.g., Poulin 1994; Heartz and
Mann 1969), recently identified commonplace books of students in the Neapolitan conservatories reveal small collections of partimenti (Cimarosa 1762;
Galeota 1753).
If we think of a partimento as a framework for a complete musical performance, then its analog in the training of actors would be the scenario of
an entire act, or of draftsmen the plan of a complete figure or portrait. The
traditions of the component schemata used in assembling a complete comedy
or drawing go back centuries. The same is true for the many schemata taught
to students of counterpoint (eighteenth-century Italian composers were often
referred to as contrapuntisti). Apprentice musicians were introduced to basic
contrapuntal schemata through regole, or rules. For example, the ninth rule

Example 1.  A schema for an upper counterpoint to an
ascending fourth in the lower voice (Ugolino of Orvieto,
mid-1400s)

(nona regula) of Ugolino of Orvieto (ca. 1380–1452) treats the contrapuntal situation de octava ascendendo (of an octave between two voices, where the
lower voice then ascends; bk. 2, ch. 26). One of his catchphrases was “Si quarta
vel quinta salit, tertiam iure poscit” (If the lower voice rises a fourth or fifth,
it rightly takes the third). Ugolino provided musical notation to exemplify
each rule. Example 1 shows the case of ascending fourths in the lower voice,
where the upper voice sounds an initial octave and then descends to a third
(his example 96).
If we go forward in time three centuries, we will find young musicians
learning the very same schema, introduced by nearly the same rule. In place
of Ugolino we can look to Raimondo Lorenzini (ca. 1730–1805/6), chapel
master of the basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome during the second
half of the eighteenth century. A manuscript of his Regolamento per il cembalo
(Rules for the Harpsichord) states that “notes [in the bass] progressing by ascending fourths and then by descending thirds take the five” (“Le note che vanno
modulando di 4a in su, e poi di 3a in giù vogliono 5a”; ca. 1780s, fol. 16v; see
Example 2). Here “the five” no longer means a single interval but rather the
shorthand of thoroughbass, indicating a normal 5 triad. Lorenzini only shows

a figured bass, but he would have instructed his own students how to fashion
the traditional upper part. The last three measures of his example present the

the final tonic chord.
Today we can confirm the continuing vitality of Ugolino’s schema in
Lorenzini’s era by examining eighteenth-century compositions or pedagogical
works. From the literature, one could point to a keyboard work of Francesco
Durante (1684–1755), who studied in Rome early in the century (Durante
1747–49; see Example 3a). And from pedagogical material one could highlight a passage from a collection of partimento fugues used within the Bach
circle (Renwick 2001, 107; see Example 3b).

After introducing the basic schema, Lorenzini went on to detail a common variation. He stated that these same bass notes “can also have one note
with the five and the other with the nine, following the idea of the composer”
(“Possono pure avere una nota 5a, e l’altra 9a secondo l’idea del compositore”;
ca. 1780s, fol. 17r; see Example 4). The “nine” means a 9–8 suspension, which
often required a third over the even-numbered bass notes. In Neapolitan
manuscripts, the presence of this third is sometimes indicated by the Roman
numeral “X,” as in X (“X” = 10, a two-digit number being potentially confusing

tion to illustrate one type of “move of the fourth that changes the key” (“Il
modo di quarta che cambia tono”; Doll ca. 1760s, fol. 32r). In my realization of
Doll’s bass (see Example 5), the descents of the upper voice (the “X”s) collide
with tones retained from the previous chord (the “9”s). Lorenzini’s “idea of
composers” may thus also include a canon between the voices, which is already
implicit in Ugolino, Durante, and Bach (see Examples 1 and 3).
The association of implicit canons with this particular schema was something usually taught by a master. Occasionally, however, this craft knowledge
was committed to print. Referring to sequences, the German organist Andreas
Werckmeister (1645–1706) wrote, “Now if a subject [in the bass] should proceed by regular intervals, then it is quite easy to make a canon above it” (“Procediret es [= Subjectum] nun in gleichen Intervallis, so ist gar leicht einen
Canonem darauff zu machen”; 1702, 116). Example 6 presents two of Werck­
meister’s several ideas for canons with a rising-fourths motive, along with realizations of those same ideas in a Bach fugue.
Just as the oval-and-cross schema was not a face but a scaffolding for
drawing a face, so a contrapuntal schema was a frame for adding the motivic
cues of real music. In his Principes de composition (ca. 1720s), Nicolas Bernier
(1665–1734), who was a student of Antonio Caldara (1671–1736) in Rome
and later became master of music at the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris (the private

begins almost as a quote from Ugolino: “When your bass begins by an ascending skip of a fourth or a fifth” (Bernier ca. 1720s, 24); he then offers several
canonic scaffolds, always alternating perfect and imperfect consonances. Two
that, in Ugolino’s term, “take the third” are shown in Example 7.
In his section on “embellished counterpoint,” he then gives a rule for
decorating melodic fourths within this schema: “The skip of a fourth occurring within the measure ought to be embellished by four equal notes, then it is
only the first and the fourth which count” (Bernier ca. 1720s, 36; see Example
8a). When he introduces the embellishment of an already embellished bass

Example 9.  Bernier, Principes, a summary exercise in the use of dissonances

(see Example 8b), his new rule seems more like a general maxim than a prescription for how to arrive at his specific examples: “One must make all the
notes either ‘parfaite’ [1, 3, 5] or ‘mixed’ [6], and if one encounters a false
fifth or some other ‘imparfait’ [2, 4, 7] interval, then one must resolve this
dissonance by descending one degree” (38–39).
After introducing the general treatment of dissonance he provides
“some exercises” with more realistic basses (50). He places figures above the
bass, but they represent a literal upper voice, not generic chords. A third voice
is implicit, and in this author’s realization (see Example 9), that implicit voice
(shown in the alto range in smaller noteheads) can complete the contrapuntal
rising-fourths schema, making a forceful drive to the ensuing cadence in the
key of A minor. Bernier’s didactic bass, though almost indistinguishable from
real music at the Sainte-Chapelle, is fully comparable to the second schema of
Lorenzini (note Bernier’s “9” in the second measure and then his cadenza doppia; cf. Example 4) and to the much earlier model of Ugolino (cf. Example 1).
Thus, in terms of the practical training of composers, improvisors, and accompanists, the eighteenth century of Werckmeister, Bernier, Durante, Bach,
Lorenzini, and Doll has as much and perhaps more in common with the fifteenth century of Ugolino than with the nineteenth century and its Romanticera textbooks on “the science of harmony.”
The importance of exemplars

Rousseau had started life in an artisan’s family but through a series of misadventures became the lover of the monied Madame de Warrens in the duchy
of Savoy near his native Geneva. She made it possible for him to complete a
gentlemanly education, in the course of which he obtained, probably in the
later 1730s, a book that offered a scientific approach to music: “While we were
fighting in Italy,1 they were singing in France: the operas of Rameau began

1  By “we, Rousseau likely means the French, and the his”
torical context is probably the wars of the Austrian succession. The larger context of the Confessions makes it clear
that Rousseau never was a soldier.

to make a noise there, and once more raise the credit of his theoretic works,
which, from their obscurity, were within the compass of very few understandings. By chance I heard of his ‘Treatise on Harmony,’ and had no rest till I
purchased it” (Rousseau 1769, bk. 5). Jean-Philippe Rameau’s first modern
biographer, Cuthbert Girdlestone, relates what little we know of Rameau’s
first forty years. He was the son of an organist, went to Savoy and Milan in
Italy briefly around the year 1700, learned the Rule of the Octave in Montpellier shortly thereafter, and then, following twenty years of organ playing in the
French provinces, came to Paris and wrote his Traité de l’harmonie reduite à ses
principes naturels (Treatise on Harmony Reduced to Its Natural Principles; 1722; see
Girdlestone 1957, 2–3, 485). As Thomas Christensen has noted, “Rameau’s
theory of music was seen as a scientific system. In both method and structure,
it was frequently compared to Newton’s systematization of celestial mechanics
and optics. . . . Not surprisingly, Rameau was often granted the accolade ‘Newton of Music’” (1993, 7–8). A beginner like Rousseau, however, could not see a
way to translate these lofty precepts into practical composition: “As I began to
read music tolerably well, the question was, how I should learn composition?
The difficulty lay in meeting with a good master, for, with the assistance of my
Rameau alone, I despaired of ever being able to accomplish it; and, since the
departure of M. le Maitre, there was nobody in Savoy who understood anything of the principles of harmony” (Rousseau 1769, bk. 5).
In his Gilford Lectures (1951–52), the philosopher of science Michael
Polanyi gave a technical account of riding a bicycle in terms of Newtonian
mechanics. His tongue-in-cheek specification of the physics was intended as
a foil for his central point—that personal experience, embodied knowledge,
and the skills gleaned from apprenticeship in a living tradition can be as
important as formalized rules:
But does this tell us exactly how to ride a bicycle? No. You obviously cannot
adjust the curvature of your bicycle’s path in proportion to the ratio of your
unbalance over the square of your speed; and if you could you would fall off the
machine, for there are a number of other factors to be taken into account in
practice which are left out in the formulation of this rule. Rules of art can be
useful, but they do not determine the practice of an art; they are maxims,
which can serve as a guide to an art only if they can be integrated into the
practical knowledge of the art. (1958, 50)

It was the integrated practical knowledge that Rousseau lacked. He read
and reread his Rameau but grew convinced that it would not solve the problem at hand. If rules and principles failed, then recourse must be made to
exemplars:
By another chance I fell sick; my illness was inflammatory, short and violent,
but my convalescence was tedious, for I was unable to go abroad for a whole
month. During this time I eagerly ran over my Treatise on Harmony, but it was
so long, so diffuse, and so badly disposed, that I found it would require a con-

Robert O. Gjerdingen

siderable time to unravel it: accordingly I suspended my inclination, and recreated my sight with music.
The cantatas of Bernier were what I principally exercised myself with.
These were never out of my mind; I learned four or five by heart, and among
the rest, “The Sleeping Cupids,” which I have never seen since that time, though
I still retain it almost entirely; as well as “Cupid Stung by a Bee,” a very pretty
cantata by Clérambault, which I learned about the same time. (Rousseau 1769,
bk. 5)

The Bernier of these cantatas is the same Bernier of the Principes de com­
position mentioned earlier, though Rousseau likely never saw those rules. What
Rousseau internalized were the actual examples of the art of Bernier and
his contemporary Louis-Nicolas Clérambault (1676–1749). A collection of
Clérambault’s motets for the royal convent school at St.-Cyr, near Versailles,
was published in 1733, and a Christmas motet “Hodie Chrisus natus est” may
serve to show how close to the rule an exemplar may be. The passage marked
Plus gai with the text of praise “Gloria in excelsis Deo” (see Example 10) begins
as an exact rising-fourths canon with a bass almost identical to Lorenzini’s (cf.
JMT 51:1 2). Exemplars this ex. 10

The cantata Jupiter et Europe by Bernier contains a duet full of canons
on the rising-fourths schema (“Non, non ne craignez point”; Bernier 1703;
see Example 11). The violins begin with a canon whose motive descends a
third stepwise before leaping up a fourth. That will be the soprano Europe’s
initial motive. The baritone Jupiter, by contrast, fills in the ascending fourth
stepwise but leaps down the descending third (his part is doubled by the basso
continuo). When all four parts are in play, Jupiter’s motive is mirrored by
parallel consonances in the second violins while Europe’s motive engages in
canon with the first violins. This would be complex enough, but Bernier also
manages to include the “idea” of 9–8 suspensions (see the downbeats of mm.
101–4, 107–8; cf. Example 3). After a G-major cadence, the violins first per-

form an “embellishment” of Jupiter’s motive in sixteenth notes. They then
launch into a canon on Jupiter’s motive while the singers perform a canon on
Europe’s motive. The sum of all these parts was something deeply embedded
in, to quote Polanyi, the “practical knowledge of the art.”
If Bernier’s dazzling virtuosity was too much for Rousseau to absorb,
many other examples of the obvious type of rising-fourths schema found in
Clérambault’s motet abounded in the repertories of churches large and small.
Had Rousseau’s peregrinations taken him to Vienna instead of Paris, he might
have heard the same schema in the work of Georg Reutter (the younger, 1708–
72), the Viennese master of St. Stephen’s cathedral and the imperial chapel.

Example 12.  Georg Reutter, Messa a quattro da Capella, Kyrie, m. 64

Like Bernier, Reutter had studied with Caldara. As shown in Example 12 from
the Kyrie of his a capella mass (1744; with continuo), the two-part canon of
the model, doubled in thirds or sixths as in Werckmeister (cf. Example 6),
provides the general framework for the rising motion in the first half of the
passage. In the second half Reutter adapts the cadenza doppia to the more
g
­ alant schema of the Prinner (Gjerdingen 2007, ch. 3; cf. Example 23).
In ordinary English, an exemplar is “a person or thing which serves as
a model for imitation.”2 In the literature of cognitive psychology, however,
the word is shorn of the sense of imitation or emulation. The focus instead
shifts to the older meaning of “an instance,” and particularly to a remembered
instance of a particular experience. In matching a new experience to a host of
similar, previously stored exemplars, we may behave as if we have abstracted a
category or prototype (Nosofsky, Clark, and Shin 1989). We may respond to
the new experience as if to say “it’s one of those,” even if we have no name for
“those.” After experiencing the above dozen exemplars of the rising-fourths
contrapuntal schema, and especially if one has taken the time to play and listen to them, then one’s memory of these individually unique but collectively
coherent exemplars will be brought to bear on one’s hearing of the passage
in Example 13.
This instructional bass was written by Johann Mattheson (1681–1764),
a talented musician and diplomatic secretary in Hamburg. It comes from the
seventh of his “organ test-pieces for the intermediate level,” first appearing
in 1719. It lacks many of the surface features of the other exemplars, yet we
“know” that it is “one of those.” That is the power of a rich fund of exem2  Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1989), s.v. “Exemplar, definitions 1 and 3.

plars. The motto on Mattheson’s cover page, taken from Seneca’s ancient
letters of advice (ca. 60), reads “Longum iter est per praecepta, breve et efficax per exempla” (The journey is long by rules, but short and efficient by
examples; letter 6). Mattheson wrote two books of such exemplars in all major
and minor keys, with accompanying commentary. They were partimenti in all
but name. Yet in Hamburg, Mattheson lacked the institutional support, the
huge base of students, and the pedagogical nexus found in Naples. There the
partimento transcended thoroughbass to become a training ground for the
musical ­magination.
i
The institutionalization of craft training in Naples

For Italian musicians, the word partimento was associated with a basso continuo
as early as 1605 in the north (Venice) and 1608 in the south (Palermo), and
therefore almost from the beginnings of thoroughbass itself.3 The fact that
partimenti with explicit figures often look exactly like thoroughbass accompaniments has helped to foster some terminological confusion. Moreover,
in several Italian cities even those basses used to create independent performances were originally not called partimenti, although the word gained broad
currency later in the eighteenth century. In Rome, for example, the composer and famous keyboard player Bernardo Pasquini (1637–1710) labeled
his partimenti—independent figured basses for one or two harpsichords—as
“sonatas.” In the example shown of the rising-fourths schema (ca. 1700; sonata
no. 111 in the modern edition, mm. 6–9; see Example 14), the two harpsichords trade the explicit filled-in fourths, as each performer then implicitly
provides the descending thirds for the other. An advanced apprentice could
have learned a great deal playing at one harpsichord while his master played
at another.
In Bologna, the famous Padre Martini published what resembles a zibaldone of models for the study of imitative counterpoint. The title of this impor3  For Venice, see G. M. Trabaci, Missarum, et motectorum

the second half of m. 6 with a passage in D major

tant treatise, if rendered in English, begins Exemplars . . . (Martini 1774–76),
and a recent monograph on this treatise makes explicit its affinity with pattern
books in the visual arts (Pasquini 2004, 61–62). His work with thoroughbass
was similarly laconic. A manuscript of elementary basses by him or a member
of his school (Martini ca. 1770s?; Padre Martini’s name is listed on the cover
of the binding, but the manuscript may be in the hand of one of his assistants,
perhaps Stanislao Mattei) begins with a single page that states the names of
intervals and sets out the Rule of the Octave. After that first page, the only
phrase seen in the remainder of the manuscript is an occasional “alio modo”
(“[this could be done] in another way”) over an alternative exemplar. His
diminutions on the rising-fourths bass (see Example 15) show how to add the
cues of real musical motives to the basic framework, much as an artist might
add facial features to the oval-and-cross model of the head. All but the last of
these diminutions will work in canon according to the schemes shown in many
of the previous excerpts.
In Naples, partimento training was brought to a very high standard. Collections of partimenti by the Naples-born Gaetano Greco (ca. 1657–1728) are
likely the earliest preserved there. But as Borgir made clear (1987, 147), the
central figure was Francesco Durante (1684–1755).
Greco’s pedagogical ideas were developed and refined by Francesco Durante
into a method that remained the model for Neapolitan teachers until the end
of the century. Fenaroli’s highly successful partimento manual, reissued time
and again and held in high esteem far into the nineteenth century, follows the
format established by Durante. . . . [His] teaching method is surely one of the
significant documents in the history of continuo practice. Not only does it pro-

J our n al o f M usi c T h e ory

104

vide a solid grounding in fundamentals but it also helps develop specialized
skills such as improvising a florid line above the bass. The diminution exercises
are without parallels in the entire figured bass literature.

Durante had the advantage of working in the special environment of
Naples. There, in the sixteenth century, religious charities had established
four foundling homes for boys (conservatorii). In the seventeenth century, the
boys began to receive music lessons from professional musicians. Greco was
one of these boys and received his training in the 1670s. As Spanish wealth
subsidized the construction of ever more sumptuous opera houses and great
churches, the need for trained musicians was met by students from the conservatories. By the second decade of the eighteenth century, the conservatories
were hiring famous musicians as teachers and attracting paying students from
abroad. Nowhere in Europe was there such a concentration of talented students (several hundred). This is when Durante, himself a product of the conservatories, returned from studies in Rome (perhaps with Pasquini) to take
over from the elderly Greco as master of one of the schools. Durante’s success
and influence may have rested in part on his excellence as a composer, in the
sense that his partimenti, like Chopin’s études, transcended the merely pedagogical. But another factor was his insight into how to teach the component
schemata of the Neapolitan tradition. As a second maxim from Seneca put it,
JMT 51:1 149-3 Gjerdingen ex. 15
“facilius per partes in cognitionem totius adducimur” (“we are more easily led
part by part to an understanding of the whole”; letter 89).

  Partimento, que me veux-tu?

The “diminution exercises” (partimenti diminuiti) lauded by Borgir were
studies in the embellishment not of the bass but of the implicit, imagined parts
of a particular schema, meaning what was improvised by the performer’s right
hand at the keyboard. In the preserved manuscript collections of these exercises, verbal description is entirely absent save for the enumeration of options:
primo modo (a first way), secondo modo (a second way), and so forth. Each set
of modi or optional exemplars was followed by a complete partimento. The
student needed to study the exemplars and then determine where in the partimento they would fit. As the student progressed through a collection of these
lessons, he mastered the craft of more and more schemata. Each new partimento was an opportunity for discovery, for reinforcement of previous schemata, and for practice in knitting the component parts into a satisfying whole.
It was a nonverbal course of study that combined elements of performance,
analysis, improvisation, and composition.
Because the surviving collections of these studies are archival in nature
and preserved in libraries across Europe, we cannot say with any certainty
which partimento a student might have studied first. The zibaldone of the
twelve- or thirteen-year-old Domenico Cimarosa (1762) contains a small collection of partimenti from the regole of Durante along with some of Durante’s
easier partimenti. The zibaldone of Antonio Galeota (1753) is similarly modest
in size and filled with easier partimenti. So perhaps only older, more advanced
students would undertake the partimenti diminuiti. In any case there is no fixed
entry point into the network of patterns associated with a particular schema.
The important thing was to fix many exemplars in memory. The great seventeenth-century comedian Niccolò Barbieri noted that improvising actors
“study and fortify their memory with a wide variety of things such as sayings,
phrases, love-speeches, reprimands, cries of despair, and ravings, in order to
have them ready for the proper occasion” (1634). The students of Durante
would “study and fortify their memory” with a repertory of exemplars so that
they could apply them to the “occasion” first of a partimento and later to
both improvisation and composition. The task was enormous, but the student
would spend seven to ten years in the conservatory, studying six days a week
from dawn to dusk. The result was an ability to think in terms of complex
musical patterns.
By focusing the lens of the rising-fourths schema on Durante’s partimenti diminuiti, it may be possible both to highlight his great powers of invention and to suggest how students could “fortify” their memories. Eight of
the more than a hundred of these studies focus on the model of the risingfourths schema, and Durante offers thirteen modi—Barbieri’s “wide variety
of things”—as exemplars. Among these exemplars one can find at least ten
variants of the bass, not counting differences of key or mode. In Example 16
these basses are transposed for ease of comparison with Martini’s basses (cf.
Example 15), with which they share many features. A student needed to be
able to recognize which passages of a partimento matched which schema, and

Example 16.  Ten variants of the rising-fourths bass, from Durante’s Partimenti diminuiti

that skill in pattern recognition was fostered by learning so many variations on
the bass pattern of the schema.
Durante’s thirteen exemplars of melody-bass pairs are shown in Example 17 (transposed to match Example 16). Aesthetic doctrines in Durante’s
era emphasized the ars combinatoria (Eckert 2000), meaning that an artwork,
instead of being invented from whole cloth, involves the artful combination of
preexisting elements. Many of the basses and melodies in his exemplars could
be recombined in dozens of ways, forming an even larger pool of interrelated
exemplars. The particular combinations of bass and treble that Durante presented are representative of a broad range from the basic (Example 17, no.
12) to the recherché (Example 17, no. 13), including a selection of both the
diatonic and the modulating types.
In the Durante method a student learned to incorporate a schema into
the form and flow of the associated partimento. Any of his exemplars could
serve to illustrate this process, but let us select the tenth one of Example 17,
which has the advantage of displaying its chords in a transparent fashion. It
is of the modulating type that, in maestro Doll’s phrase, “changes the key”
(cf. Example 5). While the opening F-major chord seems stable at first, at the
second chord a melodic descent through E≤ quickly shifts the focus toward
the new anchor of a B≤-major triad. The pattern then repeats a step higher in
the second measure. The exemplar’s keyboard texture features an alternation
of sixteenth-note passagework between the hands, something quite charac-

teristic of partimento style. Note that although this exemplar is far removed
from the simple half-note model of Bernier (compare Example 7b), the tones
sounded in the outer voices at the beginning and midpoint of each measure
match that older model exactly.
The partimento that Durante wrote for practice with this exemplar is
shown in Example 18. The exemplar’s bass obviously matches the first two
measures of the partimento, and it seems clear that the pattern is meant to
continue for an additional measure (m. 3). This rising-fourths theme repeats
in C major midway through m. 6. A third statement at the original pitch begins
in the middle of m. 16. Thus, of the partimento’s twenty-five measures, nine
are occupied by obvious presentations of the rising-fourths theme. At the midpoint of m. 20, a somewhat disguised version of the theme makes a last appearance, and beginning in m. 11 a quite different adaptation of the exemplar
creates a descending four-bar sequence in the minor mode that matches the
Prinner schema. These variants account for an additional seven measures.
Only eight measures remain, all involving cadenze semplici (simple cadences).
The game of a partimento really could be that simple, though learning to perform the exemplars in different keys and to knit the exemplars together with
the cadences was far from trivial, especially for young apprentices.

My realization of this partimento, notated in Example 19, is but one of
countless ways to assemble the implied schemata and cadences (see the article by Giorgio Sanguinetti, this issue, for further information on partimento
realization). Notating a realization was not, however, an eighteenth-century
Neapolitan practice. Indeed, given the hundreds of students at four conservatories for decade after decade, it is remarkable how few fragments of notated
realizations survive. The real strength of the partimento method of teaching
was in guiding the students to develop their “presence of mind and powers of
concentration” unaided by notation.

Example 19.  The author’s realization of the partimento given in Example 18

Robert O. Gjerdingen 

  Partimento, que me veux-tu?

An ars combinatoria

The long-serving chapel master of the court of Turn and Taxis at Regensburg,
Joseph Riepel (1709–82), was a strong proponent of the ars combinatoria. In
a voluminous series of books about music, Riepel described several schemata
or models (Ger.: Muster) that every student needed to commit to memory
(1755, 44). The first of these, the Monte, or mountain, is shown in Example
20, transposed to the pitch level of Durante’s exemplars (1752, 18). Riepel’s
melody goes down a third, then up a fourth, just as in almost all the previous examples. His bass, however, is a galant smoothing of the earlier leaping
fourth—in chordal terms, instead of the root of one triad leaping up to the
root of another, there is now the third of the first triad stepping up to the root
of the second one. While the purely contrapuntal version of the rising-fourths
schema had no fixed location in the scale and key, Riepel’s Monte does, and
so does Durante’s exemplar in the above partimento. In harmonic terms, the
Monte features a move (“a change of key”; cf. Example 5) toward the subdominant, followed by a similar move toward the dominant. Or described
another way, the chromatic form of the contrapuntal schema is subsumed
under a broader cadential schema. Riepel does not speak in such terms, but
one of his subsequent discussions could be interpreted that way. Riepel’s book
on “deceptive” practices in composition includes an example that matches
the three-part rising-fourths theme of Durante (1765, 22; see Example 21; cf.
Example 19). From Riepel’s description it can be inferred that he thought of
his 51:1 149-3 Gjerdingen ex. 20
JMTexample as a type of deceptive cadence—IV–V–vi—with each pair of measures standing for one chord or for one scale degree in the cadential bass.

Example 22.  (a) Riepel’s exemplar of the Fonte schema. (b) Francesco Gasparini, excerpt from
the opera Il Bajazet (Venice, 1719)

Riepel’s second schema was the Fonte, or well (as in “down a well”). It
used the same module as the Monte, but transposed a step lower rather than
a step higher. Example 22a shows Riepel’s exemplar (1765, 2) and Example
22b shows a typical operatic example from the Venetian Francesco Gasparini
(1661–1727).
It may be tempting to see Reipel’s Monte and Fonte as merely “chord
progressions.” They contain chords, yes, but they were strongly contrapuntal
in origin. They represent centuries-old schemata: discant-tenor frameworks
transformed first into melody-bass frameworks and then adapted to stereotypical harmonic-contrapuntal sequences.
Among the most prevalent of all eighteenth-century schemata was the
Prinner, a four-stage descent in parallel tenths between melody and bass. The
downbeats of a passage from a well-known sonata of Mozart sound the core
tones of this schema (1788; see Example 23). J. C. Bach, himself an important
model for Mozart, managed to incorporate the rising-fourths schema into the
first three stages of the larger Prinner schema, as shown in Example 24 (Bach
1773–74, mm. 46–49).
The astute reader should now be catching on that the ars combinatoria
of interrelated schemata goes far beyond the musical dice games designed
for amateur composers in the days of Mozart and Haydn (Ratner 1970). In a
sense, the dice games were stories told to patrons and dilettantes, stories that

Example 24.  J. C. Bach’s exemplar of the rising-fourths schema articulating the first three
stages within a larger Prinner schema (op. 12/6, mvt. 2, mm. 46–49)

hinted at but did not reveal the secrets of the professionals. A composer who
was trained aurally in the method of partimenti was not selecting patterns
at random. He would intuitively call up from memory only the patterns that
would be appropriate for a particular musical context. Greatly talented composers like Durante, Mozart, and J. C. Bach were able to call upon multiple
schematic frames to create particularly rich musical patterns. In the works
of these artists, there are so many associations between the common musical schemata that it may be wrong to think of schemata as wholly separate
categories. Take, for instance, the well-known rising contrapuntal pattern
5–6–5–6. . . . Note how one of the 5–6–5–6 thoroughbass exemplars given by
Durante 149-3 Gjerdingen ex. 25
JMT 51:1 in his partimento “rules,” or regole, presents the now familiar risingfourths bass (Example 25).

Example 26.  Durante’s regula for the 9–8 suspension

The more one learns of eighteenth-century style, the more such relationships emerge. For instance, in Durante’s regole, the exemplar of the 9–8
dissonance follows an ascending leap of a fourth—the same “idea” mentioned
by Lorenzini (see Example 26; cf. Example 2). Note that the dissonance occurs
above scale degree 4, something that may seem incidental to us but that was
likely memorized as an integral part of the praxis of partimenti.
Durante placed his model 9–8 dissonance (Example 26) in the larger
context of the rising-fourths schema and its following cadenza doppia. Similarly,
only a few chromatic adjustments would be needed to incorporate Example
25—Durante’s 5–6–5–6—into Riepel’s schema of the Monte. Were the bass of
Example 25 to sequence downward, by contrast, it could be easily fashioned
into a Fonte or a Prinner. Indeed, a Fonte begun in a major key, with a typical
two-measure design, could be extended through two more measures to form
a four-bar Prinner that ends in the relative-minor key. And this is just what
Durante implicitly calls for in his partimento of Example 17 (see mm. 11–14).
Craft knowledge of these possibilities for the ars combinatoria would emerge
from intensive training carried out over a period of many years. Achieving a
degree of fluency in these transformations and associations would characterize the shift from apprentice to young master.
Solfeggi: A significant fund of exemplars

A young student in one of the Neapolitan conservatories did not spend every
waking hour at the harpsichord. There were lessons in religion, lessons in
Latin, lessons on an instrument, and lessons in singing. This last type of activity, judging from the number of exercises preserved in manuscripts, must
have been extensive and important. The above-mentioned Santini collection
in Münster, for instance, contains more than six hundred solfeggi in dozens
of ­ ompilations.
c
Unlike the dry nineteenth-century exercises for solo voice still studied
in conservatories today, an eighteenth-century Neapolitan solfeggio was a duo
that paired a graceful melody with a partimento-like unfigured bass. That is,
every melodic tone was uttered in the context of a partimento—in a complete musical context. This huge, practically unstudied repertory of solfeggi

Robert O. Gjerdingen 

  Partimento, que me veux-tu?

115

(penned by many of the greatest composers of that era—including Mozart)
thus constituted a perfect microcosm for learning this musical language. In
effect, apprentice composers memorized both a lexicon and a phrase book
of melodic material contextualized by its association with partimento basses.
Since many of the same boys who learned solfeggio melodies would also be
trained to realize a partimento, their partimento work at the keyboard must
have cued for them a number of memories of solfeggio melodies. The earlyseventeenth-century commedia dell’arte actor Pietro Maria Cecchini (1563–
ca. 1630) emphasized that “the actor must see to it that his mind controls his
memory (which dispenses the treasure of memorized phrases over the vast
field of opportunities constantly offered by comedy)” (1628). This idea of creating a rich store of memories from which one can later draw (as influenced
by the artistic moment) can be mapped directly onto the practices of the Neapolitan conservatories. In daily rehearsal, the boys learned to “study and fortify” a “treasure of memorized phrases” from partimenti and solfeggi. When
realizing partimenti at the keyboard, when improvising, or when composing,
they could “dispense” those phrases from their “rich store of memories.”
The musical pas de deux of solfeggio melody and partimento bass can be
illustrated with excerpts from some of the many solfeggi of Leonardo Leo, a
stylistic paragon of the Neapolitan school. In the excerpt shown in Example 27
(Leo ca. 1730s), a student would have encountered an exemplar that forms an
excellent match to both the older contrapuntal model and the newer Monte.
In Example 28, by contrast, the student would have learned how to embellish
and invert the melodic intervals: 27 descending third of the model becomes
JMT 51:1 149-3 Gjerdingen ex. the
an ascending sixth, the ascending fourth becomes a descending fifth.

Example 29.  Leonardo Leo, XII Solfeggi, no. 8, Larghetto, m. 10 (Naples)

Embellishment and transformation feature again in the excerpt shown
in Example 29. Tonally, the excerpt begins like a Monte by focusing first on
the fourth scale degree (A≤ in the bass of m. 11). The appearance of F4 as
the low note of that measure’s melody indicates an intervallic shift from 5 to
6 above the A≤ bass. The 5–6–5–6 thoroughbass pattern continues as the bass
ascends stepwise to B≤, C, D, and, through a descent of seven notes in both
voices, finally to E≤, the local keynote. At each rise of the bass, the melody
completes a descending scale to land a third above the new bass.
A student would eventually begin to “feel” these patterns, with the effect
of dozens of memories of similar exemplars governing what seemed right
and wrong. For the Naples-trained student, the pattern of rising fourths in
Example 30 might look like the rising-fourths schema, but it would not “feel

along with modern annotations that spell out the contexts likely to be noticed
by an apprentice. In the most general terms, these contexts are: Rule of the
Octave, cadence, modulating cadence (“Mod.” in Example 32), sequence,
and pedal point.
While a student might have learned dozens of exemplars for each type
of context, let us examine only a few for the sake of simplicity. Example 33
presents a minimal set of exemplar tesserae from which one can construct the
mosaic of a realization for this partimento. Each one is itself an amalgam
of various smaller patterns. Those exemplars with smaller noteheads in the
upper part are modern realizations from Durante’s thoroughbass regole. The
others are originals from his partimenti diminuiti, with all but the first of those

they are labeled tesserae 1–8, and all have been transposed to F major for ease
of comparison with the bass of Example 32.
One of the benefits of partimento instruction was that a student became
adept not only at transforming exemplars into different keys, modes, and
meters, but also at combining or merging them. Example 34 demonstrates
how one might adapt the tesserae of Example 33 to the several contexts of the
bass from Example 32. Alongside the labeled contexts in Example 34, numbers indicate which tesserae were chosen. Indications like “(1 + 5)” mean a combination of tesserae 1 and 5, that is, incorporating the 9–8 suspension of tessera 5
into the Rule of the Octave of tessera 1. Some of Durante’s exemplars are themselves composites. Tessera 9, for instance, melds a 9–8 suspension into each
stage of a larger Prinner. An exemplar by Doll was chosen for the concluding
pedal point.
The realization of Example 34 was made intentionally simple and sectional to reflect what might be possible through stages of improvisation. Thus,
there was no attempt made, as would be characteristic of a more “literary”

Robert O. Gjerdingen 

  Partimento, que me veux-tu?

cated, composed realization by one of the greatest masters of this style (Bach
1730–31).
Each realization of a partimento is itself a modo, one specific stylization
of all the possibilities implied. To create and perform the realization, the
apprentice first had to understand those implications, which meant he had
to analyze the bass as part of becoming acquainted with it. Such an analysis
was not in terms of a harmonic system, but in terms of a web of schemata and
motives.
Achieving fluency and facility

Let us return for a moment to the scene where Rousseau was visiting the house
of Madame de Beuzenval. You will remember that she had offered him dinner
with her servants. His dismay must have been evident, at least to the Madame’s
daughter. Here is how Rousseau described it:
Without suffering my anger to appear, I told Madam de Beuzenval that I had
an affair of a trifling nature which I had just recollected obliged me to return
home, and I immediately prepared to depart. Madam de Broglie approached
her mother, and whispered in her ear a few words which had their effect.
Madam de Beuzenval rose to prevent me from going, and said, “I expect that
you will do us the honor to dine with us.” In this case I thought to show pride
would be a mark of folly, and I determined to stay. The goodness of Madam de
Broglie had besides made an impression upon me, and rendered her interesting in my eyes. I was very glad to dine with her, and hoped, that when she knew
me better, she would not regret having procured me that honor. The President
de Lamoignon, very intimate in the family, dined there also. He, as well as
Madam de Broglie, was a master of all the modish and fashionable small talk
jargon of Paris. Poor Jean Jacques was unable to make a figure in this way. I had
sense enough not to pretend to it, and was silent. (Rousseau 1769, bk. 7)

“All the modish and fashionable small talk jargon” was a closed book for the
provincial Rousseau. Either he did not grasp the idioms or understood them
too slowly to engage in rapid banter (“to make a figure”) with those more fluent. Although he had grown up speaking French and had acquired correct
grammar, the skill to converse in Parisian society seemed to require something
more. Perhaps traditional concepts of grammar are too narrow. Consider the
following proposal delivered by Joan Bybee (2006, 711) in her presidential
address to the Linguistic Society of America:
While all linguists are likely to agree that grammar is the cognitive organization of language, a usage-based theorist would make the more specific proposal that grammar is the cognitive organization of one’s experience with language. As is shown here, certain facets of linguistic experience, such as the
frequency of use of particular instances of constructions, have an impact on
representation that we can see evidenced in various ways, for example, in speakers’ recognition of what is conventionalized and what is not, and even more

121

122

J our n al o f M usi c T h e ory

strikingly in the nature of language change. The proposal presented here is
that the general cognitive capabilities of the human brain, which allow it to
categorize and sort for identity, similarity, and difference, go to work on the
language events a person encounters, categorizing and entering in memory
these experiences. The result is a cognitive representation that can be called a
grammar. This grammar, while it may be abstract, since all cognitive categories
are, is strongly tied to the experience that a speaker has had with language.

Rousseau’s experiences in the provinces were encoded in his provincial
“grammar,” while his Parisian dinner partners had had quite different experiences of “language events.” Of the strategies or principles needed to interpret
a written or spoken “language text,” the language-use scholar John Sinclair
(1991, 109–10) has described two, of which Rousseau was highly gifted in the
first and, in that refined Parisian setting, deficient in the second:
In order to explain the way in which meaning arises from language text, we
have to advance two different principles of interpretation. One is not enough.
No single principle has been advanced which accounts for the evidence in a
satisfactory way. The two principles are:
The open-choice principle
This is probably the normal way of seeing and describing language. It is
often called a “slot-and-filler” model, envisaging texts as a series of slots, which
have to be filled from a lexicon which satisfies local constraints. At each slot
virtually any word can occur.
The idiom principle
The principle of idiom is that a language user has available to him or her
a large number of semi-preconstructed phrases that constitute single choices,
even though they might appear to be analyzable into segments.

By “idiom” Sinclair means not just opaque expressions like “to kick the
bucket” (= to die), but a whole range of unitized or partially unitized collocations of words gleaned from the statistics of our experiences with language. Before the advent of massive databases of spoken and written English,
assertions about the great importance of knowing thousands of ready-made
phrases were tentative and provisional (Prodromou 2003, 43). Today, with
transcribed corpora of natural speech involving billions of words, those assertions can be quantified. A pilot study by Erman and Warren (2000) examined
the question of how big a role is played by “prefabs” in written and spoken
English. They defined a prefab as “a combination of at least two words favored
by native speakers in preference to an alternative combination which could
have been equivalent had there been no conventionalization.” As an example,
they noted that a native speaker would interpret “good friends” differently
from “nice friends” (i.e., “good” can equal “nice,” but “good friends” means
“close friends”). Remarkably, these authors found that 40 to 60 percent of the
content of the texts analyzed was made of prefabs, supporting the importance
of Sinclair’s idiom principle.

Robert O. Gjerdingen 

  Partimento, que me veux-tu?

Rousseau’s difficulties with Parisian idioms and prefabs were mirrored
in his relationship to refined music composition. With his copy of Rameau’s
treatise, he had Sinclair’s open-choice principle. That is, the harmony text
seemed to set out a slot-and-filler model. Harmonic grammar consisted of
three slots (tonic, subdominant, dominant) in a preferred sequence, and a
large number of chords that could fill each slot. Rousseau knew that this was
not enough, as did Rameau (who was not responsible for the frequent oversimplifications of his many treatises), but as Rousseau put it, “The difficulty
lay in meeting with a good master” (1769, bk. 5). Figured bass could provide
the vocabulary of chords—the lexicon—for filling the open-choice slots, but
a master would be required to teach the large repertory of unitized phrases—
the phrasicon—needed for fluency. Without the phrasicon, the result would
sound like the utterances of a nonnative speaker. According to Gwyneth Fox
(1998, 33), who began her career teaching English to foreigners and later
became the editor of the Macmillan English Dictionary: “When even very good
learners of the language speak or write English the effect is slightly odd. There
is nothing that is obviously wrong, but somehow native speakers know that
they would not express themselves in quite that way. The problem is often one
of collocation.”
The problem of collocation might explain some of Rousseau’s difficulties as a composer. Take, for instance, the following cadence from the aria
“Quand on sait aimer et plaire” in Rousseau’s Le devin du village (1752, scene
5, Andante; see Example 36). The melody by itself is fine. The bass by itself is
fine. Their collocation, however, “is slightly odd” at the asterisks in Example
36, and the eightfold appearance of this cadence within the aria removes any
question of a misprint. Italian composers of the type admired by Rousseau
would occasionally retain two (but never three) notes of the tonic triad (G
major) as the bass rose from scale degree 3 to 4 and then to 5 (Gjerdingen
2007, ch. 11). But Rousseau’s particular utterance does not match any items
in the galant phrasicon. It is a testament to the power of schematic hearing
that his phrase still sounds acceptable, in the sense of not having obviously
“wrong notes” in spite of the clash
JMT 51:1 149-3 Gjerdingen ex. 36 between melody and bass. Example 37
presents a reconstruction of Rousseau’s cadence in “native galant,” preserving
his deceptive-cadence bass and the contour of his melody.

Example 37.  A reworking of Rousseau’s cadence to conform with standard galant usage

In Rousseau’s day a musician could hardly avoid noticing the risingfourths schema, especially in its modernized version as the Monte. In the aria
from scene 6, “Tant qu’a mon Colin j’ai su plaire” (1752, Mesuré andante,
m. 53; see Example 38), Rousseau fluently sets forth the canonic version of
the rising-fourths schema, harmonized as a standard Monte. It is the following cadence, however, which again is slightly odd because of a problem in

A pedant might point to the ascending movement of both outer voices to
the octave G5 (at the star on the example) as the stylistic faux pas. Yet “direct”
or “covered” octaves, where the upper voice moves by step, were explicitly
sanctioned in the eighteenth century. Instead, the fault lies in Rousseau not
recognizing that a different bass was the preferred collocate for his melody.
Example 39a shows Rousseau’s cadence with the more idiomatic bass (now
a cadenza semplice), and Example 39b (transposed for comparison) shows
how J. S. Bach also chose the idiomatic bass for that class of melody. Bach’s
cadence comes from his figured-bass harmonization of the sacred song “O
Jesulein Süss, O Jesulein Mild” (1736, BWV 493). It is perhaps worth noting
that Bach’s version, which comes out of his thorough training as an artisan,
does not sound at all odd even though it is contrapuntally much harsher, with
direct motion to a major seventh in place of Rousseau’s octave (see the starred
location, Example 39).

BWV 493, m. 3

Rousseau’s musical compositions were occasionally original, as he hoped
they would be, and fashionable at times, as part of the new wave of sentimentality and sensibility. They were never, sadly for him, considered profound,
and his output remained very slight by eighteenth-century standards. It is possible that without professional training and skills he found composition arduous, especially when more than melody and accompaniment were required.
His relationships with professional musicians were never easy. Around 1745 he
had composed an opera titled Les muses galantes (The Galant Muses, lost). He
showed it to the well-connected composer François-André Philidor (1726–95),
but Philidor indicated little interest in it. In Rousseau’s Confessions, he relates
what happened when he persuaded, with difficulty, the author of his harmony
text to listen to excerpts from this opera:
Rameau consented with an ill grace, incessantly repeating that the composition
of a man not regularly bred to the science, and who had learned music without
a master, must certainly be very fine! . . . Rameau, the moment he heard the
overture, was purposely extravagant in his eulogium, by which he intended it
should be understood it could not be my composition. He showed signs of impatience at every passage: but after a counter tenor song, the air of which was
noble and harmonious, with a brilliant accompaniment, he could no longer
contain himself; he apostrophised me with a brutality at which everybody was
shocked, maintaining that a part of what he had heard was by a man experienced in the art, and the rest by some ignorant person who did not so much as
understand music. It is true my composition, unequal and without rule, was
sometimes sublime, and at others insipid, as that of a person who forms himself
in an art by the soarings of his own genius, unsupported by science, must necessarily be. (1769, bk. 7)

Rousseau had experienced the effects of great training “with rule” when
he was personal secretary to an ambassador in Venice:

126

J our n al o f M usi c T h e ory

A kind of music far superior, in my opinion, to that of operas, and which in all
Italy has not its equal, nor perhaps in the whole world, is that of the “scuole.”
The “scuole” are houses of charity, established for the education of young girls
without fortune, to whom the republic afterwards gives a portion either in marriage or for the cloister. Amongst talents cultivated in these young girls, music
is in the first rank. Every Sunday at the church of each of the four “scuole,” during vespers, motettos or anthems with full choruses, accompanied by a great
orchestra, and composed and directed by the best masters in Italy, are sung in
the galleries by girls only; not one of whom is more than twenty years of age. I
have not an idea of anything so voluptuous and affecting as this music; the richness of the art, the exquisite taste of the vocal part, the excellence of the voices,
the justness of the execution, everything in these delightful concerts concurs
to produce an impression which certainly is not the mode, but from which I am
of opinion no heart is secure. (1769, bk. 7)

These schools (scuole) were, of course, the Venetian ospedali, the equivalents for girls of the Neapolitan conservatori for boys. The Neapolitan boys,
who were being groomed for professional employment, likewise worked for
years to achieve fluency and facility. It is in these terms that Borgir (1987,
147) describes the practical advantages of training in partimenti for future
composers:
The advanced sections as a whole may be seen as a keyboard approach to learning composition. The player had to recognize at sight opportunities for using
diminutions, imitations, motivic interplay, etc., and thereby developed compositional skills. A central aspect of this training was the necessity of working out
musical ideas on the spot. The ability to compose quickly was particularly
important in opera where a new work often needed to be completed in the
course of a few weeks. The partimento method was uniquely suited to develop
the facility needed for such a task. The method was developed and practiced at
the Neapolitan conservatories, and it is hardly coincidence that their graduates
dominated the field of opera for much of the eighteenth century.
Later reception

The term partimento began the eighteenth century as a regional variant of basso
continuo. Neapolitan maestros, instead of viewing basso continuo as a mechanical process for deriving chords from a numerical shorthand, developed their
own system for training performers and composers. They used basses as cues
for the recall and adaptation of various styles or modi, which in turn were
constructed on the framework of numerous schemata taught by rote. The
power of this system, which helped ensure the success of hundreds of indigent boys, lay in its simple method of integrating the craft knowledge of small
harmonic-contrapuntal schemata into the aesthetic, performative experience
of a complete musical movement. It was wonderful training for composers
and improvisors, who learned how to create a total fabric from a single thread.
Partimenti and solfeggi were thus factors in the rapid emergence of Naples as

Robert O. Gjerdingen 

  Partimento, que me veux-tu?

one of the great centers of music. Naples-trained composers and performers
so dominated the world of eighteenth-century music and secured so many top
positions at courts and cathedrals that they were often resented by local musicians abroad. To compete, maestros in other cities began adopting partimento
methods, and over time the term partimento became known across Europe as
something distinct from basso continuo.
In the nineteenth century, Italy generally continued the partimento tradition, though as noted by Fellerer (1934) the emphasis shifted away from
improvisation and toward harmony lessons with written exercises (Sanguinetti
1997; see also the article by Stella, this issue). Printed copies of Fenaroli’s partimenti, with textbook-like annotations by later editors, dominated the scene
even through the first decades of the twentieth century. Luciano Berio (1925–
2003) may have been one of the last major Italian composers who trained
with partimenti. As a young boy of six he was given a copy of Fenaroli by his
grandfather (Berio 1982, 99). Berio worked through those venerable studies
much as Neapolitan boys had done two centuries before. As an inducement,
his grandfather told him that Giuseppe Verdi (1813–1901) had studied the
same book.
At the close of the eighteenth century, the situation in France was chaotic due to the Revolution. Textbook-like printings of Neapolitan partimenti
and solfeggi began to appear in Paris (see Cafiero, this issue), but the attacks
on churches and the nobility removed the patronage that had supported the
training of young musicians. In response the state stepped forward to establish
a Conservatoire along the general model of Naples. Perhaps due to the rebellion in Naples against French rule, the new head of the conservatory was someone trained in Bologna: Luigi Cherubini (1760–1842). Cherubini was a student of Giuseppi Sarti (1729–1802), who had been trained by Padre Martini.
This Bolognese orientation was later reinforced in 1826 by the appointment
of Auguste Panseron (1795–1859) as professor of composition. Panseron
was trained in Bologna by Stanislao Mattei, who was also a student of Padre
M
­ artini.
Panseron’s treatise of 1855, Traité de l’harmonie pratique et des modulations,
en trois parties, à l’usage des pianistes (A Treatise on Practical Harmony and Modulation, in Three Parts, for the Use of Pianists), represents the mainstream French use
of partimenti in the nineteenth century. As its table of contents reveals, partimenti were intended to reinforce and consolidate harmonic skills in more
realistic contexts:
Part 1. A Complete Treatise on Practical Harmony
Part 2. The Art of Modulation
Part 3. Partimenti. Assignments and lessons to be played at the piano or
written out.
After World War I, the impact of Parisian teaching on American students
was profound. Many composers moved to Paris and worked their way through

127

128

J our n al o f M usi c T h e ory

collections of partimenti. Nadia Boulanger (1887–1979), who taught many of
these ex-patriots, routinely assigned the partimenti contained in a harmony
text by Théodore Dubois (1921). Walter Piston (1894–1976), future author of
a widely read American book on harmony, completed a fugue “On a Theme
by Fenaroli” for Boulanger (Piston ca. 1924–26). The theme was taken from
Fenaroli’s partimento fugue in D minor, bk. 5, no. 3. Piston did not realize
Fenaroli’s partimento as a keyboard work. Instead, he used the theme as the
kernel for a disposizione a 4 (i.e., a four-voice arrangement in open score) in
the style of a French fugue d’ecole (“school” or “academic” fugue, an offshoot of
the Italian partimento fugue). He transposed the key to B minor, arranged the
parts for string quartet, and inserted a number of sequential episodes or divertissements to meet the strict formal requirements of the fugue d’ecole. Toward
the end of Piston’s fugue, where Fenaroli originally wrote rising sequences,
Piston composed two versions of the rising-fourths schema, both with a Corellian “leapfrog” series of 2–3 suspensions in the violins (Gjerdingen 2007, 471).
His real fluency in the use of these schemata is demonstrated in Example 40,
which presents the first such episode and the beginning of an embellished
second one.
In 1926, Archibald T. Davison, Piston’s former professor at Harvard and
his future colleague, wrote a book titled Music Education in America: What Is
Wrong with It? What Shall We Do about It? He contrasted the generally weak training received by young Americans with that of their counterparts in Europe,
and he quoted a “graduate of the Music department of an American university, now studying in Paris” for firsthand evidence of French rigor (could the
“American in Paris” have been Piston?):
A conservatoire class in harmony, counterpoint, fugue or composition has
three two-hour sessions per week, compared to our three one-hour sessions at
home. To be admitted to a harmony class, you must have finished the text book
work and are required to pass an entrance examination testing your knowledge
of it. In America the text book work is done in class and you complete your
course when you have finished your text book. In other words, here harmony
begins at the point where at home it ends. Once admitted to the class you work
at “partimenti,” unfigured basses and melodies (from 20 to 60 or 80 measures
long), usually in instrumental style, which have been culled from Fenarolli [sic]
and other seventeenth and eighteenth century Italians and from “continuo”
parts in Bach. Their “realization” demands extensive use of all the devices of
imitation and a constant eye for melodious part writing. . . . You are admitted
to the counterpoint classes without examination upon obtaining a “premier
prix” in harmony. (Davison 1926, 140–41)

The situation in nineteenth-century Germany and Austria was far more
complex. No one city, institution, or teacher was clearly dominant. There
were, of course, many Italians working in German-speaking lands. Antonio
Salieri (Vienna), for example, wrote partimenti (Mertin 1984, 166; they were
lost in World War II), and Gaspare Spontini (Berlin) was trained on parti-

menti in Naples. There were also many Italian-trained Germans working back
home. An example would be Christian Weinlig (1780–1842), who studied partimenti with Mattei in Bologna before returning to Dresden and later Leipzig,
where he was cantor of the Thomaskirche (like J. S. Bach). Weinlig’s students
included Clara Schumann and Richard Wagner. The article by Ludwig Holtmeier (this issue) details the great extent of partimento training in Germanspeaking lands.
Another factor shaping the reception of partimenti in Germany and
Austria was the indigenous tradition of “Fundament” treatises (Christensen
2008), analogues of basso continuo treatises in Italy. Michael Haydn, for example, wrote figured-bass exercises for his students. Some years later a former
student published them as Haydn’s Partitur-Fundament (1833). Yet a contemporary reference to these exercises describes them as “74 pages of partimenti”
(Becker 1836). In the same vein, the continuo parts for many south German
sacred works look very much like partimento fugues, with changes of clef to
accommodate shifts in the register of the vocal parts. Compare, for instance,

the excerpt of the partimento fugue from the Bach circle (Example 3) with
a passage from the mass movement by Reutter discussed above (see Example
41; Example 12 is from earlier in the same work). This partimento-like summary of a multivoice texture was also employed by Johann Eberlin (1702–62)
in Salzburg, and copied by the Mozarts (Gjerdingen 2007, 381–82).
Summary

Fellerer (1934) categorized partimenti as a subset of thoroughbass. The two
arts share a focus on basses and a performance tradition centered on keyboard
instruments. He also drew attention to partimenti as an art of improvised
performance, whether in service playing for organists, or for the training of
composers studying with maestros. The above discussions have focused on the
sophisticated cognitive skills developed in connection with partimento training. A partimento player needed a good musical memory, skill in adapting
dozens of harmonic-contrapuntal schemata to the “opportunities afforded”
by the bass, and facility in reproducing the exemplars taught by his maestro
or learned from solfeggi and other repertory.
Rousseau had learned something about solfeggi. He mentions solfeggi
“composed by the celebrated Leo” in his Dictionnaire (1768, s.v. “Solfier”: “On
a, en Italie, un Recueil de leçons à Solfier, appellées Solfeggi. Ce Recueil,
composé par le célèbre Léo, pour l’usage des commençans, est trés-estimé”).
But he never found a master and so never acquired the polish and powers of
invention that training in partimenti might have given him. Of course, it is
also possible that his antipathy toward any kind of strict apprenticeship might
have prevented him from embarking on such a course. He may have wished
the technical insouciance of Le devin du village to help reflect its unstudied
hero and heroine. He could argue that few works in Paris had greater success than his small opera. In his later novel on ideal education, he describes
how his pupil Emile will shun conventional representation: “I will, therefore,
carefully avoid giving him [Emile] a drawing master who would give him only
imitations to imitate and would make him draw only from drawings. I want
him to have no other master than nature and no other model than objects”
(1762; Bloom trans., 143–44).
Rousseau’s Romanticism was a precursor of nineteenth- and twentiethcentury notions about how the ideal artist might learn “from nature.” But this
public idealization is contradicted by our records of how great artists did in

Robert O. Gjerdingen 

  Partimento, que me veux-tu?

fact learn. Visual artists learned models from pattern books and from copying the great masters. Improvisational comedians learned routines from their
zibaldoni. Traditional composers copied the scores of great masters, learned
models from a maestro, and practiced performing them with the aid of zibaldoni filled with regole, partimenti, and solfeggi. As Gombrich noted (1956,
167), the visual pattern books “can really be compared with vocabularies.”
Similarly the studies used in the Neapolitan conservatories provided both a
lexicon and a phrasicon for the construction of fluent music. With a harmony
book alone, Rousseau could never attain the fluency of the elite musicians who
were his contemporaries.
After Thomas Attwood (1765–1838) finished two years of study with
maestros in Naples, he traveled to Vienna to begin lessons with Mozart.
According to the Irish tenor Michael Kelly—who had studied singing in
Naples with the famous castrato Giuseppe Aprile (1731–1813), had first met
Attwood there, and had been performing in Vienna at this time—Mozart said
that Attwood, of all his students, came closest to Mozart’s own musical style4
(Kelly 1826). Though Attwood would never achieve Mozart’s level of mastery,
the two of them could converse as speakers of the same musical language
because, through partimenti and solfeggi, Attwood had achieved a significant
measure of fluency. Mozart, himself composer of at least three Neapolitanstyle solfeggi, also wrote some variations (K. 532) on a theme by Kelly, and
the flattered singer asked the maestro if perhaps he ought to take up counterpoint on the road toward becoming, like Attwood, a real composer. Mozart
said, “My good lad, you ask my advice, and I will give it you candidly; had you
studied composition when you were at Naples, and when your mind was not
devoted to other pursuits, you would perhaps have done wisely” (Kelly 1826,
224). We can now infer with some confidence that the valuable Neapolitan
training to which Mozart referred, and which Attwood had received from the
masters Felipe Cinque (n.d.) and Gaetano Latilla (1711–88), was centered
around solfeggi and partimenti. Solfeggi by Latilla, for instance, appear in
an important Parisian print of 1772. Today the main partimento manuscripts
of Naples are once again available for study (Gjerdingen 2005). Following
Mozart’s advice, we might “do wisely” to study them if we wish to understand
the training of eighteenth-century composers.
To answer the question “Partimento, what do you want of me?” one
might say “recognition, and possibly engagement.” We ought to recognize
that partimenti were an important and perhaps the central locus of craft training for eighteenth-century musicians. And we might engage with the surviving

4  “Attwood is a young man for whom I have a sincere affection and esteem; he conducts himself with great propriety,
and I feel much pleasure in telling you, that he partakes more
of my style than any other scholar I ever had; and I predict,
that he will prove a sound musician” (Kelly 1826, 225).

partimenti both for their rich store of exemplars and for their readiness to
offer a still-viable method of musical training. For intrepid twenty-first-century
voyagers who venture into the virtual world where a partimento’s imaginary
voices can be heard still singing out the schematic patrimony of a centuriesold tradition, there are intense experiences to be shared with the elite musicians of the eighteenth century. Those experiences may in turn change our
perceptions of fully notated eighteenth-century compositions. Partimenti may
ask a great deal of us, but they offer much in return.
