OF

KIRNBERGER

MARPURG
by

Joyce Mekeel
New School for Music Study
N.J.
Princeton,
During the years 1722-1760, Jean-Philippe Rameau published the
series of treatises
in which he developed his theory of harmony, a
theory that changed the musico-theoretical
thinking of his own time and
Certain of his contempogreatly affected that of future generations.
raries were quick to recognize the value of his ideas; others rebelled
to be abstract theorizing
far removed
against what they considered
from actual musical problems.
Friedrich Wilhelm Marpurg (17181795) belonged to the first category.
He regarded himself as the first
and interdisciple of Rameau in Germany, the official disseminator
This was most unfortunate for Rameau, for
preter of his theories.
of Rameau's theories
Marpurg did not understand the full significance
and, as we shall see, questioned statements without having fully understood their context.
For example, he missed entirely one of Rameau's
most basic views: that melody, even unaccompanied melody, has its
roots in harmony. Indeed, he even states a contrary view: "Aus T6nen
entstehen Intervalle, und aus Intervallen Accorde [Handbuch bei dem
Vol. 1, 2nd ed., p. 4]2' And the basis of Marpurg's

method for deriving a scale is the erroneous experimental observation
of a subharmonic series reported by Rameau in his G6enration Harmonique (1737) and later corrected in D6monstration du principe de
l'harmonie (1750). Marpurg seems never to have read the latter; at
least, he did not correct his mistake.
In contrast to Marpurg, Johann Philipp Kirnberger
(1721-1783)
regarded himself as a practical theorist.
He bitterly opposed theories
which he regarded as being far removed from practical musical problems.
Some aspects of his work reflect the thought of the generation
of his teacher, Johann Sebastian Bach, but the most significant aspects
of his work face the future and are reflected in the writings of a later
generation.
Before making a closer comparison of the ideas of Kirnberger
and Marpurg it may be helpful to survey their major writings.
Marpurg wrote prolifically on many subjects: counterpoint, harpsichord playing, ornamentation and performance practice,

figures of speech with which he attacked Sorge.

The theories of Kirnberger are contained in two works: Die Kunst
des reinen Satzes, 2 vols., 1771-79 [Kunst]; and Die wahren Grundsatze
zum Gebrauch der Harmonie, 1773 [Harmonie]. The first is the definitive work; the latter is shorter, giving more attention to the fundamental
bass and problems of musical analysis.
Its relationship to the Kunst
as well as to Kirnberger's
student, J.A. P. Schulz, are explained by
Siegfried Borris (2, 97-81. A second and even more condensed treatment of harmony is his Grundsgtze des Generalbasses,

speculation, the results are sometimes
Yet, in matters
of practical theory and harmonic analysis,
he seems to be a man of
greater musical insight than Marpurg. In the remainder of this paper
the theories of each of these men will be taken up separately, beginning
with those of Marpurg. Primary attention will be given to their views
on basic chord material,
its derivation,
and dissonant combinations
such as the 9th, 11th and 13th chords.
We will then use the Anhang as
the basis for a comparison of their views on the fundamental bass and
certain problems of harmonic analysis involving the question of essential and "accidental" (non-essential)
discords.
Throughout his writings Marpurg seems to be unaware of the evident inconsistency
between his avowal of French apostleship and his
We have quoted him as saying, "Aus T6nen
openly dissenting opinions.
entstehen Intervalle, und aus Intervallen Accorde"' The extent to which
this statement is at odds with the theories of Rameau becomes apparent
when one understands that by "T6nen" Marpurg means scales.
This
meaning is clear not only from the discussion that follows the statement
[Handbuch, 4-5] but also from the order in which various musical materials are considered.
First he discusses
the means by which scales
(diatonic and chromatic) are derived.
He then obtains his chord material from this melodic material.
Rameau, however, first derives
intervals from the senario, then major and minor harmony, and only
after that does he construct scales.
Marpurg considered Rameau's system to be incomplete [Untersuchung, 136]and offered instead a "combined Rameau-Marpurg system:'
In order to be complete, he maintained, a system must contain all
possible tones, intervals, and chords, insofar as they are possible
practically. This requires twenty-one pitches in an octave - although Marpurg does not give a table of them; and from a two, three, or four-fold
combination of these, all possible intervals and chords may be derived
[Untersuchung, 136]. The basis for his method of scale construction is
an error of observation made by Rameau in his Generation
Harmonique
(1737). In a series of experiences
Rameau seems to discover not only
the origins of major harmony in the senario of a
vibrating string, but
also the origins of minor harmony in the co-vibration of
strings whose

THEORIES OF KIRNBERGER AND MARPURG
are the essential elements in the construction of 9th, 11th, and 13th
chords, Marpurg is forced to consider the diminished 7th chord as a
fundamental chord [Untersuchung, 186; Musicus, 175; 181]. However,
as his various descriptions
of that chord reveal,
Marpurg is by no
means completely

diminished 7th appears as one of several types of 7th chord, and is
described as the diminished 7th chord constructed from the minor diminished triad G#-B-D-F
which is found only on the raised 7th degree
in A minor [Untersuchung, 165]. In an earlier part of the Musicus he
flatly states that the diminished 7th chord is not a fundamental chord.
It is a "borrowed harmony" (eine erborgte Harmonie) on the raised
leading-tone in minor derived from the inversion of the chord of the
augmented second on the natural 6th degree in minor, F-G#-B-D
[Musicus, 181]. Yet, further on, in his description of the construction
of 9th, 11th, and 13th chords, we find these examples: 1) the 7th chord
B-D-F-Ab as the essentialchord
of the 11th chord E/B-D-F-Ab;2
2) in
minor, the fifth (E-B) of the chord is often changed to a minor sixth, in
which case this llth chord A/F-G#-B-D
is derived from the augmented2nd chord F/F-G#-B-D;
3) the chord with major third and diminished
fifth E, G#, B, D, F, which does not differ from the foregoing chord exand the 11th
cept that the ninth is minor, the 7th chord B/B-D#-F-A,
chord derived from it E/B-D#.-F-A
[Musicus, 211]. These statements
of course do not outweigh those of the Untersuchung which was written
ten years later.
There Marpurg maintains a sphinx-like silence when
on such dangerous ground.
In the last examples from the Musicus (B/B-D#-F-A
and E/BD#-F-A) Marpurg has touched upon another thorny question, that of the
augmented 6th chord.
Although the examples of 9th chords given in
the Musicus include such chords as the 9th chord derived from the
augmented second on the 6th degree in minor (which is built by subposing a root, not at the interval of a third, but at the interval of a
fourth below the "7th" chord F/F-G#-B-D),
and the 9th chord G/B-D#F-A derived from the "fantastic" 7th chord B/B-D#-F-A,
there is no
reference to anything resembling an augmented 6th chord [Musicus, 202].
Yet, ten years later Marpurg came perilously close to recognizing the
augmented 6th chord when he stated that the chord F-A-B-D#
came
from the "fantastic" 7th chord B-D#-F-A.
The augmented 6th chord
F-A-C-D# comes, he says, from the 7th chord D#-F-A-C.
Of the two,
the former is the more frequently used, and both chords result from
the mixing of two keys, A minor and E minor [Untersuchung, 167]. Although he describes these chords as belonging to a species of 7th chord
which is used only in an inverted form, he does not say that they are
fundamental chords, as are most of the 7th chords.

terval of which may be doubled. This is unusual in view of the cardinal
rule of the time that the major sixth could never be doubled when accompanied by a minor third. The triad on the leading-tone (semitonum
modi), however, is consistently referred to, not as vermindert, but as
falsch.
A strong connection exists between Kirnberger's
views on the
six-four chord and those on essential and non-essential
dissonance.
The consonant six-four chord, like any essential dissonance,
can occur either on a weak or on a strong beat. It may be taken without preparation and any note may be doubled. In fast eighth-note passages it
is treated as passing and not figured.
The dissonant six-four chord,
like any unessential dissonance,
can occur only on the strong beat - as
a suspension or as an appoggiatura. It mustbe treated as a dissonance,
with both fourth and sixth prepared and resolved.
In the former instance the six-four chord represents a triad in second inversion; in the
latter it is a triad with the fifth and third delayed by suspension or appoggiatura [Kunst I, 51-2; Harmonie, 13]. There is also a third case,
in which the sixth may enter freely but the fourth is treated as a dissonance, as a suspension to the third. In this case the six-four chord
a sixth chord whose third is delayed by suspension or aprepresents
poggiatura [Grundsatze, 67]. Examples of all three may be seen in the
passage below, which is taken from the Grundsatze.

JOYCE MEKEEL
If Kirnberger does indeed regard his bass as "what the French theorists
call the fundamental bass," Marpurg certainly has proved him to be in
error.
His last sentence contains the essence of the French point of
view. The fundamental bass, as originally conceived by Rameau, cannot contain more than what is contained in the original example. Therefore, in this sense Marpurg is correct when he calls Kirnberger's
fundamental bass an "interpolated" bass.
In the Gebrauch Kirnberger explains his interpolations
in the
fundamental bass, asking first: "What harmonies are fundamental to
this passage?:"

THEORIES OF KIRNBERGER AND MARPURG
Thus, Marpurg and Kirnberger have expressed diametrically opposed points of view on two important questions:
1)

Does chord progression affect the determination of the
fundamental bass?
Kirnberger says yes.
Marpurg
says no.

2)

Are suspensions
or non-essential
essential
dissonances?
Kirnberger
says they are non-essential.
Marpurg says they are essential.

as essential dissonances
Marpurg is forced to consider suspensions
because of his views on the structure of 9th chords.
(The ninth must
be viewed as an essential dissonance to conform to Rameau's "melody
from harmony" principle.)
as essential
By regarding suspensions
dissonances
Marpurg is forced to consider each vertical combination
of pitches in isolation.
To Kirnberger the fundamental bass, in association with this view of suspension and essential dissonance proved to
be an inadequate and restricted tool of harmonic analysis.
Marpurg,
committed as he is to his views of suspensions
and essential dissonance, is not free to hear the longer span of harmonic relationships
which Kirnberger appears to comprehend.
The length of these spans
is sustained by what to Kirnberger seems to be the most natural harmonic progression,
up a fourth or down a fifth. He has defined essential dissonance in terms of this bass progression, and with very few
exceptions his "interpolations" and Uebergdange der Resolution are made
in favor of "that progression which makes the harmony more natural"
In analysis his predilection for this progression
sometimes leads him
astray, for example in his analysis of the following passage:
Example 22.

... it is impossible that these successive sixth
chords are inversions of triads.
In such a short time,
how can we have E major, D minor, E minor, etc. which are
incapable of possessing such a close [temporal] relationship?... the following analysis of these six chords shows
that they are nothing less than six chords with an anticipation in the upper voice, and are thus built from a
natural progression of fund-imnntal harmony [Harmonie,45].

JOYCE MEKEEL
The fundamental bass for the extended example in the Kunst (Ex. 5,
p. 185) moves almost entirely in fourths and fifths.
Kirnberger has
analyzed the passage to show a series of dominant-tonic relationships.
And although the fundamental bass he has given is a travesty of the
original conception of fundamental bass, it is completely logical aurally, to modern ears at least.
For all their differences,
Kirnberger and Marpurg have two
in common.
characteristics
First, neither was an acoustician.
The
derivation of the materials
of music was relatively
unimportant to
them.
In the preface to the Gebrauch Kirnberger expresses
extreme
annoyance with foggy French mathematics and begins his book with the
unequivocal statement that the basic chords in music are the triad and
the 7th chord.
Although Marpurg was more interested in acoustical
do not treat
problems than was Kirnberger his theoretical treatises
them in great detail.
Both men were practical theorists
concerned
primarily with immediate problems of harmony and analysis.
Finally,
Marpurg and Kirnberger have equally little affinity for the theories of
Rameau: Marpurg by virtue of misunderstanding
(and misrepresenting)
them, Kirnberger by virtue of his more advanced point of view.
