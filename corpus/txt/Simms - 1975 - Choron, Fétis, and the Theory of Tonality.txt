was then that he developed a lifelong interest in the history of
music theory. His first important writing was a treatise on
harmony completed by 1816, but not published, as he tells us,

important theorist of harmony in France.

nineteenth-century
In the early 1830s, Fetis's writings on harmony and the history
of harmony underwent a substantial change, for it was at this
time that he claimed to have discovered a principle of music
that he called "tonalite", which he considered the source of all
harmonic rules and which indirectly delineated the major eras

himwhile walking alone in the Bois de Boulogne in 1831. "Suddenly the truth appeared to my mind; questions were clearly
stated, the darkness vanished; false doctrines fell one by one
about me. " And Fetis sat beneath a tree for hours pondering
the importance of his discovery. *3
In the spring of 1832 he gave a series of eight lectures in Paris
which were summarized in various
describing his theories,
issues of the REVUE MUSICALE for that year. He subsequently
developed the theory of tonality in his "Preface et resume
de la musique" (1835), the "Esquisse
philosophique del'histoire
de l'histoire de l'harmonie" (1840), the TRAITE COMPLET DE
LA THIORIE ET DE LA PRATIQUE DE L'HARMONIE (1844),

articles in the REVUE MUSICALE and REVUE ET GAZETTE

Choron (1771-1834) was an important and
respected figure in French musical life in the early nineteenth
century and a man whose works do not deserve their present

According to Fetis, he soon acquired "more

were compiled into massive, encyclopedic works intended to
cover the entire theoretical gamut of music. The most notable
of these was the PRINCIPES DE COMPOSITION DES I COLES
D'ITALIE (1808), which included an original treatise on harmony, a new edition of Marpurg's TRAITt DE LA FUGUE ET
DU CONTREPOINT (1756), examples of fugues in Italian style
from Nicolo Sala's REGOLE DEL CONTRAPPUNTO PRATICO
(1794), and examples of early vocal polyphony from Giambattista Martini's ESEMPLARE O SIA SAGGIO FONDAMENTALE PRATICO DI CONTRAPPUNTO (1774-75).

Yet

all intervals have another, independent "harmonic" or "dynamic" quality, which is the relative stability of the interval or its
tendency to progress to another interval.
Speculation about the dynamic nature of intervals in the study
of harmony began inRameau's TRAITSE DE L'HARMONIE, with
his stipulations for resolution of the "major dissonance" (the
augmented fourth) and the "minor dissonance" (minor seventh)
which occur in a dominant seventh chord. The idea was elaborated in Kirnberger's GRUNDSAETZE DES GENERALBASSES
(Vienna, n.d.), where the fourth and seventh scale degrees are
discussed as leading tones, especially
when heard simultaneously in a dominant seventh, thereby giving the interval and
chord an innate tendency for movement. *16
Fetis expands upon these notions in the MtTHODE ,LItMENTAIRE and later works. Not only do intervals and chords have
innate dynamic or stable qualities, he says, but scale degrees
do as well. The perfect intervals of a fifth and octave have

pertain to reposeful scale degrees (1, 4, 5, and sometimes
in harmonizing a bass.
Fetis's idea of reposeful or non-reposeful scale degrees in the
METHODE EL]LMENTAIRE was advanced because he needed
some way of explaining the "regle d'octave," or standard aswhich had been a
cending and descending scale harmonizations,
feature of nearly every harmony and thorough-bass manual to
that time. The concept of reposeful scale degrees for Fetis at
this time, in other words, was his means of justifying why a
triad should harmonize some scale degrees, while
root-position
inverted triads or seventh chords should be appropriate elsewhere. He would have done well to have left the idea at that,
but later makes it an important "law" of tonality, even though
the idea is often used in a contradictory way, without any real
usefulness or factual basis to begin with.
The intervals of an augmented fourth and diminished fifth are of
particular
importance to Fetis, because their "mysterious"
dynamic quality is the basic relationship de termining our modern
tonality.

The transitonic order in music was ushered in by the transition
from old to new tonality--from
the modes to major and minor
keys. Music could now modulate and establish various tonics,
hence the name of the era. The new tonality did not evolve
over a long period of time, but was established
in essence by
Monteverdi, who discovered the "phenomenon" of natural dissonance. When the expressive qualities of unprepared seconds,
sevenths, and tritones were unleashed in music, Fetis speculates, these harmonic relationships and their obligatory resolutions quickly established a new scale-our
major scale-which
maintained an invariant interval structure at all pitch levels.
Monteverdi's "discovery" was that a root-position
triad could
be embellished by an unprepared seventh (and ninth), as long
as the resolution of the chord was what nature prescribed:
the
seventh descending by step, the third ascending by step, and,
the root descending by fifth.
Thus, Monteverdi
optionally,
discovered the "natural harmony of the dominant," the acceptance of which established modern tonality.
It is Fetis's idea that no composer prior to Monteverdi resolved
a dissonant seventh at the same time that there was movement
in other parts. *25 In other words, all dissonant sevenths were
resolved to what he would call a ? chord as shown in Example
1. The dissonant seventh here is what Kirnberger would have
called "zufallig" ("accidental")or
what Catel would have called
"artificial."
Such a resolution is supposedly different from that of the "natural harmony of the dominant" as used by Monteverdi, where
the third had to resolve upward at the same time that the dissonant seventh resolved downward (Example 2). The dissonant
combination in Example 1 created no "feeling for a cadence"
since it resolved to a sixth chord, which was inappropriate to
the dominant scale degree. The second example somehow does,

His statement on the necessary resolutions of pre -Monteverdian
theorists
dissonance ignores the teaching of sixteenth-century
such as Vincenzo Galilei and Giovanni Artusi, who allowed
movement of the tenor at the same time as resolution of a dissonance in the counterpoint, and who admitted unprepared tritones and sevenths providing that proper resolution followed.
Fetis also ignores musical sources utilizing innovative treatment of dissonance that go back to the time of Cipriano de Rore;
in other words, he ignores all theoretical and practical documents of the "second practice," of which Monteverdi was only
a part.

or "marche de basse," which were stock harmonizations
scales or sequential bass patterns.
In summary, Fetis's theory of tonality is certainly not the
advance in the study of harmony which he thought that it was.
But tonality was still essential to his manner of thought; it was
an aspect of theory which he as a rationalist considered absolutely necessary as a means of explanation of the rules which
he advanced.
Tonality for Fetis was what multiple resonance was for Rameau
or what numerical cosmology was for the Pythagorean theorists
-a source of authority.
In this respect, however, he was out
of touch with his times.
The trend in theory of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries was away from rationalism and toward an empirical approach to theoretical matters,
where musicians were willing to accept and describe without
the need to explain or to prove. This insistence on proof is
the first failing of his entire work, because it led him to create
something that was not there. Another shortcoming of Fetis,
Choron, and other scholars of their time was their readiness
to apply theoretic constructs appropriate to their own era to
music of all eras-figured-bass
concepts to contrapuntal music,
tonal thinking to modal music, and so forth.
One positive result of the theory of tonality, which is still with
us today, was a first step toward the redefinition of the term
itself, from a notion of scales to one of harmonic order. Fe tis's
is important today as an astheory of tonality, furthermore,
pect of the history of music theory, important because many
people in the nineteenth century thought that it was important.

nineteenth century, and many more lexicographic and journalistic articles.

Of the published studies of Choron, Vauthier's writings are far and away the
