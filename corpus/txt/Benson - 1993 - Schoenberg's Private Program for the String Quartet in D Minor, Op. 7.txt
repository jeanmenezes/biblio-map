Schoenberg's Private
Program
for the String Quartet

in D Minor, Op. 7
MARK BENSON

I n the Preface to his 1943 textbook, Modelsfor
Arnold Schoenberg gave the following advice
Beginnersin Composition,
to prospective composers.
374

... a student should never write mere dry notes. At all times he
should try to "expresssomething."Markingtempo and characterby
such terms as cantabile,
con
agitato, spirito,
grazioso,
playJul, vivace,
gay,
grave,etc., he may find that his imaginationhas been stimulated to
make him produce pieces of a definite charactersuch as a song, an
agitated allegro, a witty scherzo, a graceful gavotte, or even a nocturne or a rhapsody of vague, unidentifiable mood. Very early a
student can thus write with more spontaneity, which need not exclude conscious applicationof his technical knowledge.l
Although this passage was written to inspire students with little or no
experience in composition, recent research has shown that Schoenberg followed his own advice throughout most of his career. Indeed,
he often went beyond marking the tempo and character of his themes
to the point of writing detailed programmatic scenarios, and even
poetry. Programs of Schoenberg's device aided the genesis of works as
diverse in style as the Second Chamber Symphony, Op. 38, the Suite,
Op. 29, the Piano Concerto,

Op. 42, and the String Trio, Op. 45.2

The sheer number of programs for apparently "abstract" instrumental works is surprising, particularly because Schoenberg declared
in 1949 that he had stopped writing explicit program music after the
composition of the symphonic poem Pelleas und Melisande in 1903.
Nevertheless, Schoenberg had formed his compositional technique in
the 189os and 190os by writing Lieder and instrumental program
music. His first six published works include the Lieder, Opp. 1-3 and
Nacht, Op. 4, and Pelleas, Op. 5. These works, and also
Op. 6, Verkldrte
most of the unfinished pieces up to the year 1903, all rely to some
degree on verbal texts.
The String Quartet in D Minor, Op. 7, was the first instrumental
work Schoenberg completed after Pelleas und Melisande. He began
work on the quartet in March 1904, but did not finish it until 26
September 1905, over a year and a half later. This lengthy genesis is
atypical for Schoenberg, who generally composed rapidly. But work
on the quartet was interrupted many times, for Schoenberg was extremely busy with activities other than composition.
In the fall of 1904, he accepted his first group of private composition students, a group that included both Alban Berg and Anton von
Webern. The Vereinigung Schaffender Tonkiinstler (Society of Creative Musicians) was formed at the end of the same year, and although
Gustav Mahler was its honorary president, Schoenberg and Alexander von Zemlinsky were the principal organizers of the Society's
first (and only) concert season in 1904-05. In addition, Schoenberg's
precarious financial situation at that time made it necessary for him to
make keyboard arrangements for Universal Edition. Nevertheless,
Schoenberg was able to compose a great deal of music in 1904 and
1905 despite these many demands on his time. In addition to the D
Minor String Quartet, most of the Orchesterlieder,
Op. 8, were comin those years. Hence Schoenberg's difficulties with Opus 7
posed
were not merely practical, but artistic as well.
In the "Notes on the Four String Quartets," written in 1949 as
program notes, he explained the most significant reason for the quartet's long gestation.
und
I abandoned program-music[afterPelleas Melisande] turned
and
in a direction that was much more my own than all the preceding. It

was the First String Quartet, Op. 7, in which I combined all the
achievements of my time (including my own) such as: the construction of extremely large forms; greatly expanded melodies based on
a richly moving harmony and new chord progressions; and a contrapuntal technique that solved problems offered by superimposed,
individual parts which moved freely in more remote regions of a
tonality and met frequently in vagrant harmonies.

In accommodationto the faith of the time, this large form was to
include all four charactersof the sonata type in one, single, uninterrupted movement. Durchfuhrungen (developments)should not
be missing and there should be a degree of thematic unity between
the contrastingsections.3
From the start, the quartet was to be Schoenberg's most ambitious
composition, a compendium of advanced compositional practice in
the first years of the twentieth century.
Schoenberg remained proud of his Opus 7 throughout his life,
and he cited it frequently in the retrospective essays he wrote in the
193os and 40s. Yet he also recognized

its shortcomings,

for in the

essay "A Self-Analysis" (1948), Schoenberg admitted a defect in the
structure of the quartet: ". .. my First String Quartet, Op. 7, which I

376

dislike as little as any of my earlier works, is of an unusual length-a
great obstacle to the recognition of whatever beauty may be found
therein."4 The D-Minor Quartet is, in fact, the longest instrumental
composition Schoenberg ever wrote. It takes between forty-five and
fifty minutes to play, making it slightly longer than Pelleas und Melisande.
Table 1 presents an analytical overview of the formal plan of the
quartet. Its main headings are based on Schoenberg's 1949 program
notes.5 As Schoenberg explains, the quartet is in one movement, but
it includes sections in the style of the four standard movement-types
of the Classical instrumental sonata. These sections provide contrast
on the local level, but they are integrated into a single, large sonata
design. The themes of the component sections are related thematically by means of a sophisticated network of transformations.
Certainly, the elaborate formal and thematic ideas contribute
much to the quartet's length. But in 1940, Schoenberg hinted at another, more intriguing reason for this length. Dika Newlin, then a
student in Schoenberg's advanced composition class at UCLA, recorded the following exchange in her diary entry for 6 March 1940.
He said some of the extravagancesof the form were because the
piece was really a sort of "symphonicpoem," and when [Leonard]
Stein pressed him as to whether there was a definite programto it or

Schoenberg also provided an analytical diagram in program notes written in
1906. The main outlines of the form are not significantly different from the 1949 notes.

After

that he whispered a few words to Stein, and while I didn't catch all
he said, I understood him to reproachStein for having asked such a
question, and to say, "One does not tell such things any more!"6

378

Schoenberg's abrupt termination of the discussion apparently discouraged any further questions on the matter, and despite many
opportunities to reveal the nature of the program-such as the 1949
program notes cited above-Schoenberg maintained silence on the
matter for the rest of his life.
It is little wonder then, that when Joseph Rufer and Jan Maegaard prepared their catalogs of Schoenberg's works, they both
passed over a one-page text glued to the back cover of Schoenberg's
1904-05 Sketchbook.7 This text is the program for Opus 7, written in
Schoenberg's own hand. Christian Martin Schmidt was the first to
identify this document, and he has published both a brief commentary on the program,8 and a diplomatic transcription of the document
in Volume 2oB of Schoenberg's SdmtlicheWerke.9 translation of the
My
program is given in Table 2.
The program appears to be Schoenberg's own invention, but its
subject-anxiety over a love relationship-is a common one in German literature of the early twentieth century. Indeed, poetry on similar subjects inspired Verkldrte
Nacht and many of Schoenberg's early
Lieder. Before I discuss the content of the program further, I will
review the reasons for assigning it to the D-Minor Quartet. I will then
present evidence for dating the program and assess its role in the
compositional process of Opus 7.
The simple fact that the program is located in Schoenberg's
1904-05 sketchbook is evidence for relating it to the quartet. This
sketchbook, also known as Sketchbook I, contains the first ideas for
the piece, and over half its pages, including twenty-three of the last

sketches for the scherzo theme on page 31 (Sk32) Schoenberg wrote:

"Streichquartett, II. [Teil]/Neues
Part 2: "Feeling new life"). This heading corresponds exactly to the
title of Part II of the program (Table 2, line lo).1o
10 The line numbers for the text are in the left-hand column. Schmidt's numbering continues through a space in the text after line 6. There is nothing in this gap in the

Additional evidence can be found in the text of the program.
Most explicit are the indications for the two development sections,
one before and one after the "Neues Leben ffihlend" scherzo (lines 6
and 15 in Table 2). The locations of these development sections correspond to the ones indicated at measures B-i and G-34 in Table 1.
There can be no doubt, therefore, that this program refers to the
Opus 7 quartet.
Schmidt has suggested that the program was one of the earliest
ideas for the quartet.ll But it can be considered "early" only in relation to the piece's nineteen-month gestation. The program was not
part of the original inspiration for the quartet. The following chronology will show that the program was not written until at least four
and a half months after Schoenberg began to compose the music.
This is a crucial factor for understanding the role of the program in
the compositional process.
Schoenberg constructed Sketchbook I, the first of his large
sketchbooks, in early March 1904.12 At that time, he was working on
a different string quartet in D minor. This unfinished quartet is
known as the "D-Minor Fragment."'3 Schoenberg had drafted sizable
portions of both a fugue and a scherzo for this quartet, but had so far
been unable to complete either movement. On the first page of his
new sketchbook, he worked on several variations of the fugue theme
for his quartet. On page 4 of the sketchbook, he wrote down his first
ideas for the opening theme of Opus 7.
At the same time, Schoenberg was working on the Orchesterlieder,
Op. 8, and sketches and drafts for these songs alternate with sketches
for both the D-Minor Fragment and Opus 7 in the first forty-one
pages of the sketchbook. A chronology for the early stages of Opus 7
can be established by collating the quartet sketches with the completion dates in the manuscripts for the songs of Opus 8 (see Table 3).'4
Schoenberg completed the orchestral score of Natur, Op. 8, no. 1,
on 7 March 1904, most likely before he began using the new sketchbook. Sketches for Das Wappenschild,the second song of the cycle,
appear on pages 2-4 of the new sketchbook, and the first draft of this
song was completed on 9 April 1904. Since the first sketches for Opus
document, but in size, the space is roughly equal to two lines of Schoenberg's handwriting. Thus the text resumes in line 9. I have corrected Schmidt's letter heading in
this line to read e instead of c.

in fact, begin work on the quartet sometime in March 1904.
The score of Nie ward ich, Herrin, mild, Op. 8, no. 4 (the third song
in order of composition), was completed on 3 July 1904.'5 Sketches
for this song are found on pages 13-14, and pages 18-20. Since these
pages enclose sketches and drafts for the continuation of Opus 7 to
measure 72, which is eight bars into the D-minor return of the principal theme, we can assume that nearly all of the exposition of the
principal thematic group for the quartet was also complete by the
beginning of July.
It appears from the sketchbook that Schoenberg put the quartet
aside at this point. There are no sketches for it on pages 18-30. He
went on instead to the next song for Op. 8, Volljener Siife. This state
of affairs is confirmed

in a letter of 13 July 1904, to Oscar Posa, who

op. 8, no. 3, was not begun until 1905, and is therefore not
included in this chronology.

was chairman, and-along with Schoenberg and Zemlinsky-a founding member of the Vereinigung Schaffender Tonkiinstler.
I'm not working very much. I have begun a new song for orchestra
(the 4th). I think it will be very good. I've set myself the task, this
time, of uniting the instrumentationwith the part-writing.... My
quartet is resting.l6

382

The quartet remained at rest for some time while Schoenberg continued to work on Voll jener Siife. He also sketched ideas for other
songs intended for the cycle. The first new work on the quartet appears in the sketchbook on page 31-this is the first sketch for the
scherzo, with its programmatic label "Neues Leben fiihlend." The
outer limits for the writing of the program are thus 13 July 1904, the
date of the letter to Posa, and November 1904, when Schoenberg
completed the score for Volljener Siif3e,for which there are sketches
both before and after the "Neues Leben fiihlend" scherzo. The program was not written until at least four and a half months (and possibly eight months) after Schoenberg began composing the music for
the quartet.
Further evidence for this dating is found in the form of the program itself. Returning to Table 2, there are thee sections in the first
line, labelled a, b, and c. These are very likely Schoenberg's descriptions of the three thematic components of the completed principal
group. They are concise, and, I believe, apt characterizations of the
three themes. It is significant that the three descriptions are placed on
a single line, for in the remainder of the program Schoenberg uses
a separate line for each division of the outline, and he freely juxtaposes alternate descriptive words in many cases. This suggests that the
first line of the program was intended to characterize music already
written.
By establishing the program's position in the chronology of the
compositional process for Opus 7, we can understand its first main
function. Schoenberg wrote the program to spur his own imagination and awaken the quartet from its "rest." Apparently unable to
invent a satisfactory musical continuation for his principal group, he

assigned expressive labels to its three component themes, and invented a programmatic scenario to help him invent new themes.
The program also functioned as an outline of the formal plan for
much of the quartet (compare Tables 1 and 2). In addition to the
indications for the development sections already mentioned (Table 2,
lines 6 and 15), the program specifies the recapitulation of the principal group in line 15 with the phrase "return of the first mood, I.
i/a." Smaller scale formal patterns are also indicated. The "dejection"
and "despair" of line 2 return in line 4 after a contrasting mood,
suggesting the A-B-A shape of the second thematic group. The
repeat of a "part of II. i.a" at the end of line 12 indicates the reprise
of the scherzo. Finally, the "mild argument" specified in line 9 may
indicate the condensed reprise of all the quartet's themes beginning in
measure C-1.
Schoenberg, apparently "feeling new life" with his formal plan in
place, returned to work and sketched out the scherzo theme on page
31 of the sketchbook. The incipit of its final form is given in Example
la. On the next page, he created a chromatic version of the new
theme to serve as the subject of the fugato transition passage (Example ib). He then tested the contrapuntal possibilities of the motives of
the fugato subject. One such combination, from page 33 of the sketchbook and with Schoenberg's own motive labels, is shown in Example
ic. This particular combination suggested the final form of the first
theme of the second group, in which Schoenberg presents motives b
and c in counterpoint (Example id). Hence these themes were composed in the reverse order of their appearance in the score. Yet because Schoenberg already had his formal plan, he composed them
with their specific functions in mind. He was composing out the formal and thematic ideas embodied in the program.l7
Schoenberg now had rough sketches for three new, closelyrelated themes. But before he refined them in any significant way, he
returned to work on the end of the principal group.l8 Since the new
material was not related to the principal themes, Schoenberg took the
unusual step of writing what is, in effect, a "transition to the transition." The passage in question appears in measures 85-96 of the
published score (Example 2).

Quartet, Opus 7," Journal of the AmericanMusicologicalSocietyXLI (1988), 297-303, for

His interpretation, with which I largely agree, is concerned with the section of the
composition which encompasses the fugato transition to the scherzo.

The primary function of this first transitional passage is the gradual elimination of motives from the principal group, a process Schoenberg would later call liquidation. He considered liquidation a "neutralizing technique," which proceeds by "gradually depriving the
motive-forms of their characteristic features and dissolving them into
uncharacteristic forms, such as scales, broken chords, etc."'9 The liquidation passage in Example 2 begins with a greatly-condensed version of a motive from the first principal theme in the viola (motive x).
After several imitations in the two violins, Schoenberg "dissolves" this
motive into a rhythmically uncharacteristic broken chord (motive y,
m. 88). A second motive from the first principal theme (motive z,
violoncello, mm. 85-86) is also gradually dissolved in this passage.
The most significant part of this process appears in measures 88-89,
where motive z is syncopated and sequenced in rhythmic diminution.
Schoenberg also uses the passage in measures 85-96 to introduce
an important motive from his new thematic complex. As motives from
the first principal theme are "neutralized," a new, falling tritone motive comes to prominence. Heard first in the viola beginning on the
last beat of measure 85, this tritone will soon become motive b of the
fugato subject. Thus Schoenberg both cleans the slate of all traces of
the principal thematic group, and prepares the way for the formal
transition passage-the fugato-which begins at letter A.
Motives from the new thematic complex dominate the quartet
from this point until the recapitulation of the principal group in
measure 1-38. This large section, which takes up the entire first half
of the quartet, is heard as a continuous process of transformation and
development, yet all its essential formal and thematic features were
planned at approximately the same time.
The program was the catalyst for this burst of creative energy. It
provided Schoenberg with an expressive guide for creating themes, a
novel formal plan in which to develop this musical material, and
suggested the programmatic technique of thematic transformation to
provide unity. Not surprisingly, evidence of further work on the "abstract" D-Minor Fragment disappears simultaneously with the newfound inspiration for Opus 7.
Except for the transition to the transition between the exposition
of the principal group and the fugato-the point Schoenberg had
reached before he put the quartet to rest for a while--the first half of
the quartet is truly a seamless, single movement. Its internal segments,
the second thematic group and the scherzo, are given shape by clear

thematic returns. Yet these returns are made dynamic by the use of
unstable harmonies (see Table i). When, for example, the A-theme of
the second group returns in its original key, E-flat, at measure A-92,
Schoenberg quickly destabilizes the tonality with modulatory sequences that lead directly into the first development section. At measure G-34, Schoenberg uses the return of the scherzo theme to initiate
the second development section by beginning in the "wrong" key,
C-sharp minor, and by quickly moving even further afield. Hence
Schoenberg creates traditional formal shapes by thematic means,
while providing forward motion by harmonic means. The recapitulation of the principal group in D minor at measure 1-38 concludes
this large structure. Here, thematic reprise is accompanied by tonal
closure to halt the developmental process Schoenberg has sustained
for nearly twenty-five minutes.

388

The first half of Opus 7 contains Schoenberg's most tightly organized formal structure to that time, and this structure is outlined in
Parts I and II of the program. The structure of the second half of the
quartet, however, is much looser. Nor is there any explicit evidence of
formal planning for the second half of the quartet in Part III of the
program. The "giving over to calmer sounds" in line 16 may imply
plans for a slow movement. The "entrance of rest and harmony" in
the last line of the program suggests the quiet coda that concludes the
quartet. These are "moods," however, and no plan for their formal
realization is given.
Schoenberg did not begin to plan the themes or the formal structure of the second half of the quartet until well into his work on the
first draft of the scherzo movement. The first sketches for the slow
movement appear in Sketchbook II, the first page of which is dated
April 1905. This was at least five months after he devised the program. Schoenberg's first thought was to use motives exclusively from
the first half of the quartet for the themes of the second half, but he
soon decided to create two new themes, one to initiate the slow movement (Example 3, third system, letter K, solo violin), and one for its
contrasting B-section.2o These themes are also used, virtually unchanged except for tempo, as the A- and B-themes of the rondo
finale. This gives the second half of the quartet a thematic integrity of
its own, and binds together its two largest components.
It also removes the slow movement and the rondo from the discourse established in the first half of the quartet. Motives from the
20
See Frisch, "Schoenberg's D-Minor Quartet," pp. 303-11, for an evaluation of
the sketches for this part of the quartet.

first half are incorporated into the slow movement and the rondo, but
their appearances in these sections often have the effect of a sentimental reminiscence, rather than a continuation of their development.
Yet it is not merely the character of the new themes that make the
second half of the quartet sound like an independent piece. Their
formal presentation is different as well (see Table i). In the second
half, closed harmonic forms replace the open-ended patterns of the
first. The slow movement, which begins at letter K, shows a structure
similar to that of the second group exposition, but its B-section returns at measure L- 18 to close the movement in a static E major. This
necessitates an independent transition to the recapitulation of the
second group.
The finale recapitulates the slow movement in a textbook sonata
rondo. Except for the C-section, its themes, its textures, and its tonic
(A) are all derived from the earlier section. The B-theme that these
sections share is ultimately resolved in the tonic in the contrapuntal
recapitulation beginning at measure N-68. Schoenberg presents some
new contrapuntal combinations in the rondo, but the form, the
rhythms, and the key relationships are distinctly unadventurous, especially in the context of the first half of the quartet. It seems that the
inspiration provided by the program in 1904 had worn off a year
later.
Schoenberg, of course, recognized the separate nature of the second half of the quartet. Once again he was compelled to compose
liquidation passages-one before the slow movement, and another
after the rondo. The liquidation preceding the slow movement can be
seen in Example 3. The recapitulation of the principal group has just
ended with fortissimo, unison D's in the violins (mm. I-70-71). In the
following measures, the cello is left to neutralize its characteristic
motivic material. The break between the first and second halves of the
quartet is made explicit by the grand pause (Sehr lange Haltung) in
measure 8o.
Even more dramatic is the abrupt entry of the liquidation passage
that separates the recapitulation of the rondo from the coda of the
quartet (measure N-81, see Example 4). The contrapuntal recapitulation of the rondo begins in measure N-68 with the A-theme in the
first violin and the B-theme in the upper voices of the viola and cello.
The D-major coda begins at letter 0, and brings back the scherzo
theme and the first principal theme in transformed versions. These
themes are unrelated to the rondo themes, but the key in measure
N-68 is an emphatic A major, the tonic of the rondo, and also the
dominant of D major. Schoenberg could certainly have used this

he breaks off the final cadence of the rondo with a fortississimoliquidation passage in measure N-81. The disruptions in harmony, tempo,
tone color (am Steg), playing technique (tremolo), and rhythmic figuration all but obliterate any relationship between the two sections.
The discovery of the "private program" does not automatically
turn Schoenberg's Opus 7 into a tone poem for string quartet. However, it does shed light on its compositional process and helps explain
the "double personality" of its two halves. Each half operates in its
own thematic and formal world. Indeed, the characters of the two
parts of the quartet are so different that they suggest a formal scheme
very much like the paired sonata interpretation proposed by Richard
Swift for Verkldrte
Nacht, rather than the single, unified structure proposed by Schoenberg for his quartet.2l In this paired sonata reading,
the recapitulation of the second group of the first part of the quartet
at measure L-52 can be heard as a lyric episode between the exposition (the slow movement) and the recapitulation (the rondo) of a new,
independent sonata structure.
Schoenberg in 1904 tried to write an ambitious, abstract composition to stand with the great quartets of Beethoven. In the 1949
program notes, he acknowledged his indebtedness to Beethoven for
many of the technical procedures he employed in the quartet. This

was not enough, however. Schoenberg reached an impasse after composing the principal group of the quartet, and devised his program.
For a composer who had learned his craft at the end of the nineteenth
century, this was perhaps a more natural source of inspiration. Program in hand, Schoenberg created almost at once the themes and
the impressive formal structure of the first half of the quartet. When
the program lost its grip on his imagination, he fell back on schematic, textbook forms for the second half of the quartet. The slow
movement and rondo sections were conceived well after the programmatically-inspired components of the first half of the quartet,
and were never fully integrated with the earlier material.
The writing of "mere dry notes" was never easy for Schoenberg.
His first mature attempt to write a large-scale, "abstract" instrumental cycle-the D-Minor Fragment-was abandoned as soon as a programmatic substitute was invented. Thus his 1943 advice to young
composers-to try always to "express something," but not to exclude
"conscious application of technical knowledge"-was not merely a
pedagogical device to inspire novices, but a fruitful principle Schoenberg himself had followed for many years.
