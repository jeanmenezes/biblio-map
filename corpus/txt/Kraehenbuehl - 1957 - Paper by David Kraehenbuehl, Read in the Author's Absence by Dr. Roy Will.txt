THE PROFESSIONAL MUSIC THEORIST
there seems to be a remarkable amount of evidence to substantiate his
new assumption.
The theory which is developing out of this new hypothesis has the advantages that any new theory should have over an

itself; its basic premises are less complex but provide explanations for

of theories that is the most important business
of the professional
music theorist.
We can now see what a professional
music theorist must be. He
is first and foremost a musician.

first-hand experience of composing and performing music, should be

Thirdly, he is a professional,
spends the major portion of his time thinking about music, searching
out the clues which will lead to the development of new and useful theoretical systems.
As is always the case, the creation of new things requires thorough knowledge of the old. The professional theorist, then,
is also an expert on theoretical systems of the past.
With this summary definition, it becomes evident that a professional theorist is, of course, a rarity.
It is also clear that many who

fall short in every respect and often by a considerable
degree.
They
are what I would call amateur theorists,
if, indeed, they are theorists
at all. They are all too often persons who have failed in practical music altogether.
Their sole acquaintance with argument is in the form
of ill-mannered
polemics turning around some trivial point of nomenclature in an already ossified area of theoretical investigation.
Their
command of the verbal requirements
of the English language is superficial.

music theory" virtually God-given?
It is almost useless to explain to
them that there cannot be any such thing as the "facts of theory.'
With the definition of a professional
theorist proposed here before us, it is not difficult to determine the nature of his training.
To

He
cannot be anything else.
His undergraduate training must include extensive practical experience with music, either as composer or performer, and he must have shown a high degree of skill in his practical
work. It is unlikely that a medical school would accept a candidate who
had done poorly in chemistry, biology, and bacteriology,
although none
of these specific skills may be required of a doctor of medicine.
Likewise, no graduate school should accept as a theory major a student

Once the student is definitely aimed at the ultimate goal of becoming a professional theorist, his course work should include, in addition to further practical work in music, serious work in techniques
of scientific procedure.
How many students of our graduate schools
are required to take studies in symbolic logic, methods of psychological research, or related subjects? How many, indeed take any courses

by the general lack of understanding that the majority of performers

ultimately arrives at general principles of musical procedure.

I
received good training in the traditional substance of species counterpoint, tonal counterpoint, harmony (intermediate and advanced), form
and analysis (mostly Mendelssohn and Beethoven),
and music literature. During this time, only my piano teacher encouraged me to open
any musical book other than the rather tiresome method-books created
by various worthies for the courses mentioned.
When I finished college, I assumed, indeed, was encouraged to assume, that I had learned
theory. That was that. It was a distinct awakening to discover that
there was more to theory.
I have reason to believe that my experience
of some twenty years ago is not radically different from that of the
average music student today. It did not occur to me at the time, nor
would it occur to one of them, that there might be any such thing as
full-time professional
work in music theory, an alive and exciting
profession that might be said to be younger (because of its long dormancy) than almost any of the new sciences of our century.
To my mind, the recognition of music theory as a real professional activity with the highest professional
standards is essential.
I
do not expect a landslide of enthusiasm for such a notion. Very few
persons are in a practical position to be enthusiastic.
Nor do I anticipate the realization of such a goal in any less than 30, or perhaps 50,

If the staff is to include more than four members, one of these should be a professional
theorist, that is, someone whose graduate training was in the field of
professional
theory as we have described it. I realize that,in many
faculties financial conditions require that every faculty member teach
a variety of musical subjects.
However, I am not sure that this circumstance requires that the faculty consist entirely of instrumental
and vocal teachers who also teach some music theory. Could not such
a faculty include one professional
theorist who takes on some instru69

DAVID KRAEHENBUEHL
mental instruction as part of his duty? This would have the advantage
that any student really interested in theory would find on the faculty one
member who could discuss music theory with him at a somewhat higher
level than Kitson and Goetschius.
There would be one faculty member
who could provide the beginnings of an interest and a skill in theoretical method for a student whose talents seemed to lie in this direction.
There would be one faculty member who could demonstrate to the performers the liveliness
and usefulness of theoretical knowledge regarding the music of our own century.

their first teaching position without a single minute of instruction from
a professional pianist. And yet, many deans send students out to teach
theory who have never made the passing acquaintance of a professional
theorist.
It is more difficult to make a recommendation
regarding the
present corps of theory teachers, most of whom are clearly amateur
theorists,
many of whom would certainly claim to be nothing more.
They represent a deeply entrenched vested interest.
They must admit
both privately and publicly that, whatever it is they teach, it is more
in the manner of a musicianship skill than a knowledge of the nature of
music.
If they understand this and carry out their teaching function

truth about music is contained in their own narrow understanding that
they cause dismay among true theorists and discredit the profession of
music theory in the eyes of composers and performers alike. We can
only ask that they do not make themselves
into stumbling-blocks.
Theoretical development has already been retarded for two generations
by sloth and the firm conviction of many that the theories of the 19th
century are the true facts of music, that any departure fromthem could
only be a degradation.

If these skills must be partitioned off into separate
courses, they should be taught as efficiently as possible, perhaps without reference to theoretical principles at all.
