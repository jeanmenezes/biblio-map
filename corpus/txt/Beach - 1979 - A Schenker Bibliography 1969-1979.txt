A SCHENKER BIBLIOGRAPHY: 1969-1979

DavidW. Beach

The following compilation of information is intended as a supplement to "A SchenkerBibliography,"
publishedoriginallyin the Journal
Music Theory in 1969 (XIII, pp. 2-37), and reprinted without
of
changein Readingsin SchenkerAnalysis, edited by MauryYeston (New
Haven: Yale University Press, 1977, pp. 275-311). As in the original
study, the itemshavebeen dividedinto two main categories,"Schenker's
Works"and "Works
ConcerningSchenkerand His Theories."
Part I contains a complete listing of Schenker'smajor publications,
includingboth his theoreticalworks andhis editions of music, together
with information about which works or parts of works have been
reprintedor translated.A list of his other writings(miscellaneousessays
and reviews)has not been included here; it is availablein Appendix C
of the original
A
bibliography. useful guide to the location of Schenker's
analyses of individual works is now available in Larry Laskowski's
Heinrich Schenker: An Annotated Index to his Analyses of Musical
Works
(see Part II, Section E).
With a few exceptions only works published in the last ten years
(includingreprintsof earliersources) have been listed in Part II, which
has been subdivided here into five sections. The first (A) comprises
analyses of music of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries,arranged
275

alphabeticallyby composer. The second section (B) lists extensions of
Schenker'stheories to the analysis of (1) rhythmic structurein tonal
music, (2) early (pre-Baroque)music, and (3) music of the twentieth
century. This is followed by pedagogicalapplications(C) and criticisms
(D) of Schenker's theories. Finally there are listed other sources of
interest (E), works that do not fit conveniently into any of the
categorieslisted above.
The extent to which Schenker'stheories have begun to influence
our thinking about music is reflected in the large number of sources
listed in Part II below. Also significantin this respect is the increased
availabilityof Schenker'sown works during the past decade, both in
reprintandin translation.Forexample, in additionto the second edition
of Der freie Satz (1956), the following sources are now availablein
reprint: Beethovens neunte Sinfonie, Beethovensfiinfte Sinfonie, Das
Meisterwerkin der Musik, and the Five GraphicMusic Analyses. His
editions of the CompletePiano Sonatas and the Erlauterungsausgaben
of the late sonatas of Beethovenhave also been reissued.Until recently
the only work readily available in English translationwas Harmony
(1954). Now availableare A Contributionto the Study of OrnamentaI
tion, large portions of Das Meisterwerk and II, and Ernst Oster'slongawaited translation of Der freie Satz, publication of which was
subsidizedby the AmericanMusicologicalSociety. A translationof the
BrahmsOctavenund Quintenis scheduledfor publicationin TheMusic
Forum V.
One reason for the profusion of materialsabout Schenker'stheories
is the recent increase in the number of periodicals that deal with
theoretical issues. A few years ago the main outlets for such information were the Journal of Music Theory, first published in 1957, and
Perspectives of New Music. The appearancein 1967 of The Music
Forum greatly increased the channelsfor disseminationof Schenker's
ideas. More recently we have In Theory Only, the Indiana Theory
of
Review, and Theory and Practice (the Newsletter-Journal the Music
of New York State), all of which publish analysesand
Theory Society
articles about Schenker'stheories.In Theory Only andIndiana Theory
Review arepublishedby graduatestudentsat the Universityof Michigan
and Indiana University, respectively. (The former contains numerous
analyses and articles of various length and quality, only the most
of
substantialof which have been listed below.) Finally the appearance
Music Theory Spectrum, the official publication of the newly formed
Society for Music Theory, should be noted. It too will provide an
outlet for articles and analytic studies related to Schenker'stheories.
Some of the works listed in Part II below are directlyinfluencedby
Schenker'sideas while others are only peripherallyrelated, and some
accurately represent his approach to music while others do not.
276

Although it is beyond the scope of this study to indicate the levels of
influence and gradationsof accuracy with which Schenker'stheories
are representedfor each case, a few observationsare in order. First of
all, one cannot help but notice the recent increase of interest in
rhythmic theory and the possible applicationof Schenker'sconcept of
pitch organizationto the analysis of rhythmicstructurein tonal music.
The most direct interpretation of Schenker'sthought in this area is
found in CarlSchachter'spreliminarystudy. Many of the other works
listed, though less orthodox in their application of Schenkerianconcepts, also contain provocative ideas about rhythmic and metric
organization.Another area that has shown considerablegrowth in the
last few years is the use of Schenkerianconcepts in the teaching of
elementaryharmony and counterpoint. Here the amount of influence
varies greatly from one textbook to the next; however, the point is
not so much the level of directnessor influence in each case, but that
Schenker'sideas are more than everbefore becomingpart of the undergraduatetheory curriculum.This can only be seen as an advancein the
field of music education.
A Schenkerbibliography
would not be complete without mention of
two important sources of information about Schenker and his work.
They are the collections of Ernst Oster and OswaldJonas. The Oster
collection, housed in the New York Public Libraryat Lincoln Center,
will not be availableto the public until its contents are microfilmed.
The contents include: (1) a large number of sketches and analysesin
variousstages of completion; (2) Schenker'sscores, some of which are
heavily annotated, (3) manuscripts,including the first version of Der
freie Satz, and (4) correspondence.The Jonascollection, housed in the
main library at the University of Californiaat Riverside,is currently
being cataloguedand microfilmedfor generaluse. It contains: (1) correspondencebetween Schenker and his students, (2) Schenker'sdiary
(approximately4000 pages), (3) an incomplete book on interpretation
(Die Kunst des Vortrags), and (4) manuscripts for Tonwille and part of
Das Meisterwerk in der Musik. Once available, both collections will be

valuable sources of information for scholars and serious students of
Schenker'stheories.
