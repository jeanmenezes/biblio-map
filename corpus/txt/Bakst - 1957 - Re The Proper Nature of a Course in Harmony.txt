RE: THE PROPER NATURE OF A COURSE IN HARMONY

The many varieties of modern musical practice and the resulting

of these rules in the works of modern composers.
A skeptical attitude
often results.
Students often question the logic of harmonic restraints;
they would like to compose harmony and, invariably,
they like what
they compose - to the utter chagrin of the teacher whose opinion is
resented by students.
The problem is to evaluate the nature and function of harmony,
to formulate a logical curriculum,
and to place a course in harmony in

medium that is fixed and unchangeable, but as a course that achieves
the status of educational necessity in the musical curriculum.
We shall address ourselves in turn to the following aspects of the
problem: (1) harmony and musical forms; (2) the theory of harmony as
an abstraction;
(3) harmony, musical logic, and the essential problem
of the teaching of harmony; (4) extension of the principle of harmonic
abstraction into aspects of tonal media in general; and (5) the logical
curriculum for a course in harmony.
Music as an art is the unity of subjective and objective aspects,
that is, the unity of tonal media, purpose, idea, expression, and method.
Form in any art represents imagery and associational aspects by means
and media pertaining to the specific art.
A musical composition is
