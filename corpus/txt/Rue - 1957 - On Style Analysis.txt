Many performers feel that an analytic approach may contaminate their intuitive responses.
This view, however, fails to
consider that our apparently intuitive responses
are mostly
learned, cumulating early listening experience and the specific
instructions of teachers.
While the refined discrimination of
the finished performer requires special gifts of innate sensitivity, the broad outlines and even many of the details of his
musical responses depend on learning experiences,
and hence
to some degree, on an ordered, analytic approach.

Even the most sensitive occidental musician must doubt the validity of his responses
to an unfamiliar oriental style.
To put it another way: how
can we understand the poetry of a language until we know its
words ?
In making specific observations,
however brief, of five fundamental aspects in a musical work, we materially advance our
understanding of the piece. At the same time the better organization of our thoughts increases our ability to communicate
this understanding to others.
As we deepen our analysis, the
manner in which the five original categories
ramify depends

partly on our own perceptiveness,
upon the individual characteristics
of each historical period.
The basis of modal harmony, for example, underlies all music
up to 1600, passes gradually out of the picture during the 17th
and 18th centuries, only to reappear after long absence at the
end of the 19th century.
Such fluctuations in status of the
stylistic elements will naturally affect the internal details of

94
our critical framework.
In using an outline such as the one
below we must maintain an attitude of flexibility, making provision for special adaptations to each style under consideration.
This particular outline represents merely a point of departure,
an embryonic phase in the evolution of understanding that each
musician carries
out for himself in approaching a specific
piece.

SOUND
The category of sound includes all primarily acoustical phenomena such as timbre, texture, and dynamics, in the manipulation both of individual components and of the group as a
whole.

choices in early music), a number of detailed aspects in each

approach, however, unfortunately neglects other stylistic components, leaving the student helpless in the face of music
organized without regard to melody, such as works for percussion by Varese and Chavez.
In looking for the sources of
continuity or articulation, of derivative relationships or pointed
contrasts, we must examine all stylistic components for available clues.
Continuity, for example, results most often from
a relentless
rhythmic pulse, but may also be obtained by a
recurrent motive, a persisting timbre, or a carefully linked
while most commonly
sequence of tonalities.
Articulation,
produced by strong cadences before a rest (a harmonic and
rhythmic pause) can result with equal force from sharp changes
in orchestration or dynamic level, shifts in tempo or metrical
basis, and also from sudden tonality changes or marked alteration in harmonic rhythm. * 1
The relation of rhythm to form deserves special attention,
particularly to the larger rhythmic groupings such as phrase
and section rhythms.

Text Influence on Form
Texts affect musical form more decisively thanother aspects
of style.
Total musical length usually relates to total text
length, and all of the interior dimensions and articulations will

101
tend to reflect the divisions of the text. Text forms, such as
the refrain structures of the virelai,
obviously govern the
musical recurrences;
but we must probe deeper to check the
possible effects of more complex stanza forms, of simple rime,
and of alternating or otherwise organized lengths of verses as
reflected in the parallel musical phrasing.
HARMONY
Following the method established for musical form, the analysis of harmony commences with broad dimensions before concentrating on details. Looking first at the overall key-schemes.
the determination of tonality is often simple enough in the
Classical period. The mere statement of the keys in the movements of a string quartet, however, will not suffice.
We must
check for broader unities,
such as the special emphasis on
D major (>II) throughout Beethoven's Quartet in C# minor, Op.
131. Here the tonal unity depends as much on the dramatic
secondary tonality - the striking Neapolitan relationship as on the initial and final tonality of C, minor.
Elsewhere
than in Beethoven there may also be causal connections between the choice of tonality for an interior movement and the
tonal areas of emphasis in outer movements.
For example,
in Haydn's last piano sonata in Eb (H. XVI-52) the piquant,
almost shocking entrance of E major in the development section
of the first movement prepares us somewhat for the unprecedented use of E major in the following slow movement.

may
contribute effectively to the design of a piece.
The characterizing notes of the modes may outline a nucleus for tonality
in the Renaissance, *2 for example, and the preferred goals
for Renaissance harmonic excursions partially correspond to
later tonal modulation.
Later, in some early and middle
Baroque music the harmonic focus sharpens,
producing an
embryonic form of tonality that cruises between major and
relative minor, a bifocal tonality. *3 The possibility of a

specific routes of modulation, as well as the structure of chord
connections such as harmonic sequences and cadences, are all
significant in determining style. Finally we arrive at the chord
vocabulary itself, where the relative complexity and statistical
frequency of chords play a vital part in the musical effect.
The treatment of dissonance and chromaticism,
whether in
chord alteration or in non-harmonic notes, further reveals a
composer's individuality.
A fresh insight into musical design is offered by harmonic
rhythm, particularly valuable because it simultaneously
lays
bare the combined aspects of harmony and rhythm, an interior
and fundamental view.
patBy scanning harmonic-rhythmic
terns, it is often possible to confirm or make more precise
our decisions on the chief points of articulation, or the limits
of areas of contrast. *4 In the Classical period the organization of harmonic rhythm reaches a high degree of refinement,
but it deserves no less consideration in other periods as a
barometer of relative intensity and an indicator of articulation.
Counterpoint, though often considered an opposite pole from
harmony, actually should be considered
analytically at the
same time, since it shares many features in the combination
of lines.
Various contrapuntal devices and related processes
- echo, part exchange, imitation, canon, fugato, augmentation, diminution, stretto - all these may directly influence or

peak of sheer activity rather than a peak of line.
Several less tangible aspects of melody deserve consideration.
For example, is the melody determined or conditioned by its
medium? We may often identify types such as violin melodies
(string crossing) or organ pedal themes (separate levels for
the two feet). Many of Haydn's melodies seemto cluster within tetrachords that suggest violin hand positions.
