PROPORTIONAL EXCHANGE
IN STRAVINSKY'S EARLY
SERIAL MUSIC

AkaneMori

Igor Stravinsky'sprofoundrespect for Anton Webern'swork manifests itself in his early serial music.' The tone row that appearsin the
"Pas-de-Deux"
movementof Agon (mm. 452-62 and mm. 495-519), for
example, is quite similarto the one in Weber's VariationsforOrchestra
Op. 30 in that their intervallic patternsand symmetricalpartitionsare
almostidentical.2 twelve-tonetechniqueused in the thirdmovementof
A
CanticumSacrum(mm. 148-53, mm. 169-73, and mm. 178-83) resembles that in Weber's Quartet,Op. 22: two differentrows are assigned
to two contrapuntal
melodic lines, and partitionsof the rows switch between these two lines.
Despite these similarities,Stravinsky'sapproachto tone-row organizationexhibits severalspecial featuresduringthis period.Althoughcomposers of the Viennese School tend to use the serial method exclusively
throughouta piece-or at least throughouta movement-Stravinsky
between serial and non-serialmethodsin the early serial
freely alternates
works. Stravinskyalso employs rows with lengths other than twelve: a
four-note row in Three Songs from William Shakespeare; a five-note row
in In Memoriam Dylan Thomas; and a sixteen-note row in Septet. While

both Stravinskyand composers of the Viennese School frequentlyuse
use
contrapuntal
techniques,especially canon, Stravinsky's of the row as
227

if it were the subjectof a fugue or a canon differs from that of the Viennese School.3
This essay focuses on a special feature of Stravinsky'searly serial
works:theirproportional
formalstructure.4
Because the end of a tone row
often coincides with the end of the subject of a fugue or canon, the
of
arrangement tone rows tends to correspondwith the segmentationof
sections and the phrase structure.Comparingthe durationsof the segmentscreatedby these tone rows revealsintricateproportional
structures.
structures
My analysis revealsthatproportional
play a significantrole in
Stravinsky'smusical forms. I first examine Three Songs from William
Shakespeare and In Memoriam Dylan Thomas; I then analyze Canticum

Sacrumand draw conclusions about how its text and formal design are
connected. In the course of my analysis, questions will arise regarding
how the concept of exchange contributesto hearabledesigns in Stravinsky's music: Is it possible to hear intricateor long-range proportional
and
structuring, if so, how mightone developa sensitivityto it?This investigationof Stravinsky'sformalprocess, viewed in termsof exchange and
the
proportion,gives us new ways of understanding composer's unique
approachto serialism.
To elucidate Stravinsky'sconception of form, I introducethe notion
of "proportionalexchange." Proportional exchange occurs when a
manifestedbetweentwo segmentscan be found invertedelseproportion
where.The segments may occur in two differentvoices, or in two different sections. Because exchange requires two independentelementssuch as two segments in two voices-proportional exchange usually
occurs in contrapuntalmusic. Since Stravinskyemploys contrapuntal
technique frequently during his early serial period; this music is well
suited to proportional
exchange.
Stravinsky'smusic is also well suited to proportionalexchange because of its pronounceddiscontinuity.Discrete sections arejuxtaposed,
with no transitionbetween them. The impressionof discontinuityis further heightened by the static characterof these individual segments or
sections. Repetitivepitch organization a segmentor a section produces
in
harmonic stasis. The music's static characterand discontinuities, together,make proportional
exchange musically viable, that is, they highlight the boundariesof musicalevents which, in turn,encouragelisteners
to identify durational
relationshipsbetween segments.5
Before undertakingspecific analyses, it is necessary to consider
the general natureof exchange and proportion.Exchange is an action,
whereas proportionis a state. The former implies a change; the latter
implies a static relationship.Exchangedenotes giving and receiving, the
in
replacementof one thing with another.Proportion, contrast,denotes a
comparisonof measurable
quantities.Thusproportional
analysisrequires
228

Example 1. Webem, Kantata,Op. 29, I, m. 36
a framework which form is consideredatemporally, a static, spatial
in
as
simultaneity.
Example 1 shows instances of voice-exchange from Webern'sKantata.6The kinetic element of exchange is the process of exchange itself,
denotedin Example 1 by the unidirectional
arrows.The staticelement of
is the balanced symmetryof the whole, as suggested in the
proportion
in
visual notationalrepresentation, which a horizontaland vertical"flip"
leaves the pitch-class structureunchanged.Though both symmetryand
exchangearemanifestedin this excerpt,symmetrytakesprecedence.The
it
static,self-containedcharacter engendersoverwhelmsthe kineticqualof exchange.The analysesbelow furtherinvestigatehow the concepts
ity
of exchange and proportionrelate to each other, how one concept may
overridethe otherin a given context, and how this affects formalprocess
in Stravinsky'smusic.
Proportional Exchange And Formal Design
One of the most straightforward
examplesof proportional
exchangein
music occurs between the two outer "Dirge-Canon"
secStravinsky's
tions of In MemoriamDylan Thomas.These two outersections framethe
central"Song."Figure 1 shows the constructionin greaterdetail. Roman
numeralsindicate canons and Rs indicate ritornellos.There are two instrumentalgroups, trombones and strings. In the first "Dirge-Canon,"
each canon is played by the trombones,and each ritornellois played by
the strings.In the second "Dirge-Canon,"
these assignmentsarereversed;
the trombonesplay the ritorellos and the strings play the canons. The

partsin quarter-note
up to the attackpoints of the following parts.For instance,the firstritornello enters two quarternotes before the first canon ends, so the parenthesized number,25, is the durationof the firstcanon from its beginning
until the entranceof the firstritornello.
A proportionalexchange of durationsoccurs among the canon and
ritornellopartsof the firstand second "Dirge-Canons."
Figure 1 shows a
durationof 25 quarternotes (five 5/4 measures) for each canon, and a
durationof 16 (two 3/2 measures and one 2/2 measure)for all but the
finalritorello with a couple of adjustedvalues.While the actualcanonic
durationis 27 in some instances,I choose the parenthesizedvalue 25 as
I considerit to be the underlyingstructural
unit.The finalritornelloof 18
(ratherthan 16) reflects an elongation at the music's close. Thus, every
canon has the same length, as does every ritornello.Figure2a shows the
proportionsfor the total durationsof canons and ritornellos in the first

is exchanged-three canons and two ritomellos occur in the first"Dirgeand
Canon," two canons andthreeritornellosoccur in the second "DirgeCanon"-the proportionof durationsexchange (Figure 2a). Naturally,
proportional
exchangealso occursbetweenthe instrumental
groups(Figure 2b). The articulationof these proportionalexchanges is supported
by three factors: 1) fixed durationsin each canon and ritorello; 2) exchange in the numberof canons and ritorellos; and 3) correspondence
of the numberof instrumental
groups.Togetherthey make the structure
of the two "Dirge-Canon"
sections a convincingexampleof proportional
exchange.

to section 1), and section 4, (which correspondsto section 2), is in the

proportion 32, thatis 13: 16-again, the inversionof the 16: 13 proportion which appearedbetween sections 1 and 5. Figure 3b (p. 233)

Proportional Exchange Between Voices
And Compositional Procedure
The fourthmovementof CanticumSacrumconsists of threesections,
each of which featuresproportionalexchange. The mannerof their appearanceandtheirratiosaredifferentin each section. The second section
is a canon while the firstand the thirdsections consist of a baritonesolo
and two other layers. The tone row employed throughthis movementis
the same as the one in the thirdmovement,<9 8 10 0 1 11 4 3 6 2 5 7>.
In each section the assigned text can be divided into two large parts,and
the tone rows supportthese divisions. These featuresset up the proportional exchange thatoccurs.
Example 2 shows section 1, which consists of three layers: baritone
solo, chorus, and instrumental
long notes. This section divides into two
partsaccordingto the text division. Both partsbegin with an instrumental prelude(mm. 250-54, and mm. 262-65). The preludeto part2 begins
at the exact center of the section. Thus, both the first and second parts
have the same duration: eighth notes. Althoughthe meterchanges,the
60
tempo is stable, so the clock-time durationsare also equivalent.
In section 1, the baritonesolo is echoed by the chorus.As shown in
Example2, Pgis used for the baritonesolo and its echo in part 1. In part
2, R9 is used for the baritonesolo and its echo. Partof the pitch organization of parts 1 and 2 is thus palindromic.The first segment in part 1
(mm. 254-57), sung by the solo baritone,is namedX1 on Example2 and
the echo of this segment, sung by the chorus from mm. 257 to 258, is
namedXI'; subsequentbaritonestatementsare labeledY1, Y2, and X2,
with correspondingechoes Y ', Y2', and X2'. Y2 and Y2' are so named
because they include retrograde
statementsof the last four pitch classes
in Y1 and Y1'. Anotherlayer, Z, consists of instances of a single pitch
class played by the trumpetor trombone.The attack-points these pitch
of
classes coincide with the last note of each baritone solo segment. For
example, at Z1 (m. 256) the trumpetjoins the last note in the baritone
solo, Db4, and remainson that note throughhalf of m. 259. The second
segmentin this layer (shown as Z2) consists of the tromboneG3 from m.

in part 1,Y 1 andY1', have the same length, duration11, as do the second
segment and its echo in part2, X2 and X2', namely,22.10In Example 3,
numberspresentedunderthe braces reveal anothersignificantsimilarity
between parts 1 and 2. The durationfrom the attackpoint of X1 to the
attackpoint of XI' is 16 (labeled xl), and the durationfrom the attack
of
point of YI to the attackpointY1' is 8 (labeled yl). The proportion xl
to yl is 2: 1. The durationbetween the attackpointsY2 andY2' (labeled
y2) is 8, and between the attackpoints X2 and X2' (labeledx2) is 4; thus
the proportion y2 to x2 is also 2: 1. Therefore,in both parts 1 and 2,
of
the proportionof the baritonesolo segments, until the attackpoints of
theirechoes, is 2: 1. Further, firstecho segmentsof parts1 and2 indithe
cate parallelconstruction:
both xl' andy2' comprisedurations 7 eighth
of
notes. So two segments with identicaldurations,xl' and y2', are placed
between the two segments,xl and y 1, and y2 and x2, whose proportions
are 2: 1.
Comparisonof correspondingsegments reveals another significant
structural
relationshipbetween parts 1 and 2. The proportionof the first
baritone solo sections, xl to y2, is 2 : 1. The same proportioncan be
foundbetweeny 1 and x2, the second baritonesolo sections.The duration
of yl is 8 and the durationof x2 is 4, so the proportion yl to x2 is also
of
2 : 1. On the otherhand,the proportion
ofY (in part 1) to X2 (in part2)
is 11 : 22, thatis, 1 : 2. Since Y 1 andY ' both have duration11, and since
X2 and X2' both have duration22, the proportionof Y1' to X2' is also
1: 2. Figure 4b summarizesthe proportionsof the correspondingsegments in parts 1 and 2.
Independentof the correspondencesbetween parts 1 and 2 shown in
Figure4a, proportional
exchange occurs between segments within these
parts, as Figure 4b shows, that is, the first and second segments of the
baritonesolo until the attackpoints of theirechoes in part 1 are twice as
long as the correspondingsegments in part2, while the second segment
and its echo in part 1 are half the length of the correspondingsegments
in part 2. Interestingly,the proportionalexchange does not appearbetween the segments which are relatedpalindromically.
Rather,the proportional exchange occurs between the segments which are formally
parallel. Several elements are essential for the intricate proportional
structurein the durationsof segments in this section: the construction
with the baritonesolo followed by its echo by the chorus, the length of
each segment, and the points where each segment in a voice begins.
These elements set up the proportional
relationshipsshown in Figure4a
which in turnset up the proportional
exchange.
Section 3 (mm. 281-306) presentsa slightly differentmanifestation
of
proportional
exchange, though the segmentalconstructionis very similar.As in section 1, therearethreelayers in section 3: X, Y, andZ. Example 4 (p. 240) labels the layers and the rows. LayerX is the baritonesolo

partand can be divided into three segments-X1, X2, and X3-because
of the rests. Similarly,layer Y, in which the trombonesplay, consists of
three segments,Y1, Y2 andY3. Layer Z, in which only D3 is played by
the viola and contrabass,has two segments, Zi and Z2. This section is
divided into two parts at the double bar between m. 294 and 295. This
division matches the division of the text between "credo,Domine" and
meam."The metric organizationsbetween parts
"adjuva,incredulitatem
1 and2 aresimilar:four 3/4 measures,one 2/4 measure,andone 5/8 measure, appearingin that order,followed by 3/4 measures(seven for part 1
and six for part2). Unlike section 1, this section is unevenlydivided;the
firstpartlasts for a durationof 101 eighth notes, the second for 69 eighth
notes. Although the durationsin eighths is unequal,the durationin seconds is nearly equal. At the double bar the tempo changes from quarter
note equalsM.M. 88 to quarter
note equals M.M. 60; both partsare about
34 seconds long. Because of the tempo change at the doublebar,the proportional exchange based on durationin eighth-notes is not valid for
durationin seconds. The following analysis, however, reveals that the
proportionalexchange based on notated rhythmic values nonetheless
provides significantinsights.
Proportional
exchange occurs in the main partof this section between
mm. 282 and 303, afterXI and beforeY3. The text for the XI segment,
238

the first segment of the baritonesolo, is the same as that for the second
half of the previoussection. The text repetitionprovidesa transitionfrom
the previoussection and sets off XI as an introduction section 3, rather
to
than as the beginning of its main part. In Y3, the oboe, bassoons, and
organ play, whereas in the other Y segments only the trombonesplay.
This is the firsttime thatthe organappearsin this movement;its appearance anticipatesthe next movement.ThusY3, like X , is set off from the
main partof section 3. The setting off of XI andY3 is supportedby the
pitch construction.A different tone row is assigned to each segment
except for Z1 andZ2, which areostinatosegments.R11is assignedto XI,
to
P7 to X2, and 17and its retrograde X3. P7 has three invariantsubsets
with 17,but not with R11.1 Hence X1, which uses R11,is set apartfrom
X2 and X3. In layerY, R2 is assigned to Y1, RI2to Y2, and P7 to Y3. As
with the segments in layer X, R2 has three invariantsubsets in common
with RI2,but none with P7.12So Y3, like X1, is set apartfrom the other
segments in its layer.
Example 5a (p. 242) is a proportional
graphfor section 3.13Proportional exchange appearsbetween X andY layers. The durational
proportion of Y1: Y2 is 5: 3 (45: 27). The proportionof X2 until the attack
point of Y2 (labeled x2) and X3 until the attackpoint of Y3 (labeled x3)
is about3 : 5 (32: 53). Hence the proportion : 5 occurs in layerX, while
3
its inverseproportion,5: 3, occurs in layerY in the main partof section
3.14 The following considersthe formal significanceof this proportional
exchange.
of
Althoughthe organization voices resemblesthatof section 1, some
to
adjustments entrancesof the segments in layerY take place in section
3. As in section 1, wherelayerZ alwayspicks up the last note of each segment in layer X, in section 3, layerY picks up the last note of layer X, the
baritonesolo, as shown in Example 4. The attackpoint of the first segment in layerY,Y1 in tenortromboneI, picks up the last note, B3, of XI
in m. 281. However, the same pitch as the last note (F3) of the second
baritonesolo segment(on the last beat of m. 290) does not occur until m.
292, played by the bass trombone, 8 eighth notes later than the initial
attackpoint of the last note in X2. In fact, Y2 startsfrom m. 290 with
threeothernotes, E3 andA3 played by the contrabasstromboneand Ft3
playedby the bass trombone,before the bass trombonepicks up the pitch
F3 from X2 at measure292.
Furthermore,

consideringthatthe pulse is a quarter
at
eighth note earlierthanexpected.This relatesto the retardation the end
of X2 and the beginning of Y2 (mm. 289-91). There are three groups
formed with three notes that have longer note values in each successive
group. The first group consists of the quarter-note
triplet at m. 289 to
which the text "credo" assigned.The second groupconsists of the quaris
ter notes from the last beat of m. 289 to the second beat of m. 290, to

the word"Domine"ends, the trombonesbegin to play anotherthree-note
notes. The adjustgroup.This three-notegroupconsists of dottedquarter
mentfor the entranceof Y2, namelythatsegmentY2 entersan eighthnote
earlierthanexpected, is necessaryfor the retardation the end of part 1.
at
A similar situationoccurs with the entranceof the third segment in
layerY.Y3 picks up the last note of X3, G3 in the organ,at m. 303. However, the oboe has alreadybegun Y3 two eighth notes before the organ
enters.'5Because X3 is the longest among the X segments (57 eighth
notes), two tone rows, I7 and RI7,are assigned to it. The last three notes
of RI7(Gb,Ab, G) are also the firstthreenotes of P7in Y3. The entrance
of Y3 two eighth notes early thus underscoresthe overlap between the
end of RI7 and P7.To summarize,for both entrancesof the segments in
layer Y, Y2 and Y3, some adjustmentsoccur:Y2 enters an eighth note
early andY3 enterstwo eighth notes early.
Example 5b is a hypotheticalproportional
graphomittingthe adjustments of the attackpoints of segments in layer X. As shown by asterisks
in Example 5b, the assumed durationof x2 becomes 33, and that of x3
becomes 55. Comparethese values with the notateddurationsshown in
Example5a of 32 and 53 for x2 and x3 respectively.The assumednumbers show an exact ratio, 33 : 55, or 3 : 5. Since the discrepancybetween
the assumedproportionof 3 : 5 and the notatedproportionof 32 : 53 is
small, I regardthe proportional
exchange as not affected by the adjustments. For this reason I presentthe assumedproportional
graph(Example 5b) to supportmy contentionthatproportional
exchange is an essential element of the formalconstructionin this section.
Example6 (p. 244), the second sectionof the fourthmovementof CanticumSacrum,shows another
exampleof proportional
exchangein a fourvoice choralcanon (mm. 274-80). Like the other sections of this movement,the text can be dividedinto two parts:"Etcontinuoexclamanspater
pueri,"and "cumlacrimisaiebat."Example 7a (p. 246) is a proportional
graphshowing the majorattackpoints of segments:"et,""cum,""pater,"

on the graph.The vertical lines are the notatedbar lines. The numbers
above the words indicate the duration(in eighth notes) from the attack
points of these wordsto the following words. Since a syncopatedrhythm
is a basic featureof this passage, in the graphthe attackpoint of "cum"
in the tenorat m. 276 is indicatedon the initial downbeatof the measure
insteadof on the second beat, consideringthatthe quarter is a partof
rest
the syncopatedrhythmicunit but augmented.Similarly,the attackpoint
of "pater" the alto at m. 278 also appearson the initial downbeatin the

beats. Thus the 4/4 metric structureis regularin these three measures.
Metric irregularitiesbegin to occur from m. 277 onward, because the
entranceof the discanto part is one quarternote later than the listener's
expectation.As shown in Example6, the tenorpartsupportsthe discanto
by employingthe same syncopatedrhythmat m. 277. The second andthe
thirdsyllables of the word "lacrimis"("crimis")and "cum"are assigned
to this rhythm.This delayed discantoentranceaffects the attackpointsof
244

in
the word "pater" the same voice at m. 278 and "cum"in the bass at
in
m. 277; thatis, the durationbetween the attackpoints "et"and "pater"
in
the same voice is always 8. Thus, the attackpoint of "pater" the discanto comes on the second beat of m. 278, insteadof on the initialdownbeat of the measure.Also, as the durationbetween "et"in the alto and
between
bass in m. 275 and"cum"in the tenorat m. 276 is 4, the duration
"et"in the discanto and "cum"in the bass is also 4. The attackpoint of
"cum"in the bass, therefore,comes on the fourthbeat in m. 277. Accordingly, unlike the first three measuresof this section, the attackpoints of
in
these segments,such as "et"and "pater" the discantoand "cum"in the
bass, fall on metricallyweak beats.
Example7b is a proportional
graphthat indicatesthe attackpoints of
the firstandsecondparts.A proportional
exchangeoccursbetweenthe alto
and the bass; the proportion18 : 26 in the alto exchanges with the proexchangebetween
portion26: 18 in thebass.Thereis another
proportional
the discanto and tenor.The discanto values are 14 and 16, as compared
with tenor values of 16 and 13. A metric adjustmentaffects the tenor's
durations.
The "cum"in the tenorat m. 277 appearsan eighthnote earlier
than"cum"in the bass, because the syncopatedrhythmin the tenorreinforces the delayedentranceof the discantoas mentionedearlier.Because
of this adjustment, proportional
the
exchangebetween discantoandtenor
is not numericallyexact (14: 16 exchangeswith 16: 13). As in section 3
(Examples4 and5), the proportional
exchangesoccurringin section 2 are
basedon durations notatedrhythmicvalues, andnot on duration secin
in
onds becausethe tempo changes in the last two measures(mm. 279-80).
In section 2, both of the proportional
exchanges involve not only an
betweenthe proportion segmentsin a pairof voices, but also
of
exchange
an exchangeof the durationsthemselves. Since the durationsexchanged
are in a 1: 1 relation,this example of proportional
exchange is similarto
the earlier example of voice-exchange in Weber (Example 1). Therefore, the proportionalexchanges in this section suggest an element of
symmetrymore strongly than the aforementionedexamples (Canticum
SacrumIV, section 1: Example 3 and section 3: Example5).
Proportional Exchange And Text-Setting
The following discussion of the caritas section of the thirdmovement
of CanticumSacrumconsidersin detail how text and proportional
structure can be related.This movement consists of three sections: caritas,
spes, andfides. The caritas andfides sections are similar;both of their
second partsemploy canon.The proportional
exchangesthatare strongly
affectedby the text setting occur in the canon partof the caritas section
(mm. 116-29). Example 8 (pp. 248-49) shows the canon and the row
structure.
This section is repeatedwith differenttext (mm. 116bis-29bis).

Example 8. (continued)
in the original text). "Ex toto corde tuo," "ex tota anima tua," and "ex tota
fortituadina tua" are assigned to the tenor, alto, and discanto respectively.
Thus, with respect to the text, the tenor and the alto can be divided into
three parts, and the discanto into two parts. The row structure in this canon
closely corresponds to the division of the text. In both tenor and alto, up
to the points where the repetition of "Diliges" begins, the same rows
appear twice: RIi1 for the tenor, and R4 for the alto. At the point where the

before the repetitionlasts 31 quarternotes as does the R4 row form; the
rest of the text and the P4 segmentlast 17 quarter
notes alike. Only in the
discantois the proportion text androw divisions dissimilar:the former
of
is 18: 17 and the latteris 15 : 20. Thus, in the firstcanon of caritas, the
proportionbetween the two segments accordingto text division correspondsto thatof the tone-rowdivision in the tenorand alto parts.
In the second canon (mm. 116bis-29bis), the text androw proportions
differ.Figure5b (p. 250) shows the text assignedto the second canon and
the distribution the text to its threevoices. Unlike the firstcanon,in the
of
second the entiresentence is assigned to the tenor,the sentence from the
second phraseto the end is assignedto the alto, andthe sentencefromthe
thirdphraseto the end is assigned to the discanto.There is no text repetition in any of the voices. The text assigned to the second canon can be
divided into two large segments at the semicolon: "Diligamus..." and
the second phrase starting with "et omnis...." Example 9c shows a
proportional
graphindicatingthe attackpoints of the beginning of text
phrases.Accordingto these divisions, the tenor durationsare 21 and 30
notes; the alto durationsare 18 and 30.
quarter
Because only the text differs in the second canon, its proportional
graph according to row structureis the same as that of the first canon
(Example 9b). However, comparisonof Examples 9b and 9c discloses
proportional
exchanges in the second canon not found in the first.In the
tenor, while the proportionbetween the first and second text segments
(Example9c) is 21: 30, the row proportionis 31: 20 (Example9b). In
the alto, the text proportion 18 : 30 while the row proportion 31: 17.
is
is
In the discanto,a text proportion 21: 14 exchanges with the row proof
portionof 15 : 20. In every voice of this canon, therefore,the proportion
between the two large segments according to text divisions exchanges
with thatbetween the segments accordingto the row divisions.16
The two differentrealizationsof proportional
structure the two carin
itas canons give to text setting a pronouncedformal role. In the first
canon, the proportionbased on the text division and that based on the
tone-rowdivision are parallel,while in the second canon the proportion
based on the text division exchanges with that based on the tone-row
division. The realizationof proportional
exchangein the second canon is
unlike our earlierexamples, because it depends on the superimposition
of two proportionalstructures.This allows for the voice in the second
canon to be divided in two differentways.
The audibledifferencebetween the two canons does not rely only on
their dissimilar proportions.The syllabic organizationaudibly differs.
The text assignedto both firstand second canons has 37 syllables.About
the samenumberof syllables is assignedto each alto anddiscanto:28 syllables for the alto in both canons, and 20 syllables for the discantoin the
254

first canon and 19 for the discanto in the second canon. By contrast,27
syllables are assigned to the tenorsin the firstcanon and 37 syllables are
assigned in the second canon. So the audible difference between these
two canons might more dependon these surface,textualdifferencesthan
on the occurrenceof the proportional
exchange. Indeed,the proportional
differencesbetween the canons is not readily heard. Nevertheless, as a
constructivefeature with connections to other parts of the works, proportionalexchange as an outgrowthof the text setting is, I would argue,
significantin the caritas canons.
Conclusions
This essay suggests that proportionalexchange is a primaryformal
featureof Stravinsky'scanonic compositions.It is, however,not readily
relaaudible,due to its intricaterealization.The functionof proportional
is analogous to the superstructural
ironwork of a building.

but perhapsnot on a perceptuallevel.
Proportionalexchange allows a section to be well-balanced, hence
confers a formalstability.As a result,sections thatareorganizedthrough
proportionalexchange are well-articulatedand set off in the formal
design. The underlyingidea of "exchange"is processual, and suggests
change and motion. Stravinsky,however, reinterpretsthe role of exchange, anduses it to evoke qualitiessuch as symmetry,balance,and stability.So theessence of Stravinskian
proportional
exchangelies in a transfer of the kinetic to the static.
However, a question remains: Do proportionalexchange and symmetry always performa similarfunction?In terms of formaldesign, for
example, does the symmetricalstructureof Symphonyin C performthe
same function as the proportional exchange structure of Canticum
Sacrum?Althoughthe proportional
exchanges in the analyses show sim(for
ple symmetricalstructures example, 2: 1 exchangingwith 1: 2), the
actual durationalvalues involved with the exchange are relatedin quite
abstractways.
To clarify the complex natureof proportional
exchange, I refer again
to Figure 4b, in which proportionalexchange occurs between the proportions2: 1 (the actualdurationsare 16: 8 and 8 : 4) and 1: 2 (11 : 22).
The durationsof the firstpartof the formerratio,2: 1 (numeral"2"),are
16 and 8, and those of the second part of the latter ratio, 1: 2 (again,
numeral"2"),are 22; the durationsof the second partof the formerratio
(numeral"1")are 8 and 4, and those of the firstpartof the latterratioare
11. Comparisonof these durations(16 and 8 to 22, and 8 and 4 to 11)

does not disclose obvious structural
significanceor balance.Proportional
exchange, therefore,manifestsitself throughhighly elaboratedurations.
Thougha ratiowhich is an outcome of proportional
exchangemight present a simple symmetricalbalance, the structuresof proportionalexchange actuallydiffer from symmetrybecause of theirintricacyof musical realization.
The quality of balance in Stravinsky'suse of proportional
exchange
can be appreciatedby consideringthe music spatially,atemporally.'7
In
this regard,it is interestingto note how StravinskydescribedWebem's
music:
It
[E]achopusoffersitself only as a whole,a unityto be contemplated. is
and
is
essentiallystatic,therefore, thusthe cost in subjectivity high. But
if one feels constricted
listeningto a successionof Weber's very short
the
pieces, and attributes feeling to 'lack of scope', let me say thatthe
to
in
attempt follow a chainof unitiesis a quantitative
misunderstanding
the firstplace.18
As indicatedin the analysesin this article,Stravinsky's
early serialmusic
stresseskindsof formalbalance,apartfromtemporalprocess.It is not the
intent of this article to deny the presence of the linearityin Stravinsky's
detached
music, but rather,to emphasizeaspects of the musical structure
from temporality.
Whenwe look at a painting,we areable to experiencethe work'smany
elements as we choose, withouta rigid, fixed order.Similarly,analyzing
proportional
exchange highlights significantatemporaland noncontiguous relationshipsbetween segments.The idea of proportional
exchange,
therefore,suggests that we consider atemporalstructureswithin music,
as we do for pictorial art. The analysis of proportionalexchange in
Stravinsky'smusic revealsnot only an aspect of his innovativeapproach
to formaldesign, but also the spatialaspect of his aesthetics.

1. By early, I mean works before Threni, which do not consistently use twelve-tone
rows as do the later works.
2. Henri Pousseur (1972) shows the similarities between Stravinsky's pitch organization and Weber's.
3. Stravinsky had employed contrapuntal techniques since the beginning of his
career, but the number of contrapuntal compositions increased once he became
involved with serial technique. Glenn Watkins (1986) includes a list of canonic
works found in Stravinsky's music. From this list, it is apparentthat canonic work
was concentrated in the composer's early serial music.
4. Proportional structure is also found in Bart6k's and Debussy's music. See Erno
Lendvai (1966), and Roy Howat (1983).
5. Several important investigations of Stravinsky's music have been carried out
invoking proportional structure. Edward Cone (1962) proposes a proportionally
symmetrical structure for the first movement of Symphony in C. B. M. Williams
(1973) extends Cone's analytical principles into the second and third movements
and presents a proportional structure symmetrically established over the entire
piece. JonathanKramer(1986) applies proportional structureas a principle of formal coherence in Symphonies of Wind Instruments and Agon. Kramer suggests
that in Agon the proportional ratio, 1 : 1.19, is found extensively among segments,
sections, or movements. Marianne Kielian-Gilbert's (1987) analyses of Three
Pieces for String Quartet and L'Histoire du soldat attempt to elucidate the composer's design by considering foreground pitch and rhythm, and formal organization as a rhythmic unit.
6. The term "voice exchange" in post-tonal music as used in this discussion does not
imply a transfer of all the connotations associated with the terms used in tonal
analysis, such as in Schenkerian analysis.
7. Milton Babbitt (1964) briefly mentions the construction of the row applied in this
movement. He points out the Weberian character of the row structure.
8. I label the rows taking Po as beginning on C. So P1 in Figure 3a is <B G A Bb>.
9. The graphing in this essay follows Allen Forte's (1980) method of graphing durations.
10. Strictly speaking, Y1' starts with one rest which has the value of a quarter-note
triplet (duration 1 + 1/3). However, the attack point of the Z2 segment on the
downbeat reinforces the attack point of the Y1' segment on the upbeat. Hence, in
the proportionalgraph of this section (Example 3), the attack point of the Y 1' segment occurs on the initial downbeat of m. 260, where the Z2 segment also starts.
11. The three invariantsubsets between P7 and 17are as follows:
768 101192
1 40 35
P7
4 350 1 102119
786
17
12. The three invariantsubsets between R2 and RI2 are as follows:

257

010711
894
6 5 312
R2
132
RI2 4 69 5 8 701011
13. As in Example 3, the proportional graph for section 1, the numbers in parentheses
representthe total length of each segment (in eighth notes). The numbers indicated
under the braces are the lengths of segments up to the entrances of segments in
other layers. The attack points affecting the other segments are shown by vertical
dotted lines.
14. The proportion 3: 5 or 5 : 3 is prevalent in this section. YI : Z = 45 : 27 = 5: 3;
Y1 :Z2 = 45:75=3:5;
XI :Y = 28:45
3:5. These
3:5;xl :Y1 = 26:45
proportions, however, do not appear among corresponding segments and do not
produce proportional exchange.
15. As the attack point of the segment Y1' in Example 3 occurs on the initial downbeat, the attack point of Y3 in Example 4 also comes on the downbeat of m. 303
(considering that a rest, one third of a quarter-notetriplet, is a part of the beginning of Y3).
16. The durations involved with the exchanges systematically diverge one unit from
producing their simple ratios; for example, 21: 30 exchanges with 31: 20. (Similarly, 31: 17 exchanges with 18 : 30, as does 15 : 20 with 21: 14). Because the
percentage of the deviation is small and, moreover, the proportional structure
brings about a significant difference between the first and second canon, the proportional exchanges cited here, I consider, are valuable for my discussion.
17. Robert Morgan (1980) points out that a "musical grammar" of tonality is independent of time. He mentions the concept of background in Schenkerian analysis
as an example.
