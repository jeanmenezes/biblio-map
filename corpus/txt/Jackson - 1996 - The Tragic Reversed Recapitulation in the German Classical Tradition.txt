THE TRAGIC REVERSED

genre'spossible originsin classical rhetorical dramatic

to
interrelationships considerspecific pieces in the Germanclassical tradition from Haydnto Brahms.
In late eighteenthand nineteenthcenturyGermansonataforms, parallelism between the orderof groupsin repriseand exposition is normative. Reversed sonata forms are uncommonin this traditionafter about
1770; in the few examples one can find, reversingthe groupsin the recapitulationmay have programmatic
significance.The "spatial"organization of normativesonata form is displayed in fig. la.2 In this form, the
groups in the exposition occupy "expositionspace,"the corresponding

When the exposition comprisesthreegroups,the reversedrecapitulation

A variantplaces the recapitulated

the beginning of the coda (fig. le). Another type of partiallyreversed
sonata form occurs when the groups are reversedand the first group's
firsttheme becomes the climax of the development(fig. lf).4
The essence of the rhetoricalfigureis thatit be a vitium,a violationof

since he "would

consequences. By violating the formal-tonalorder of normativesonata
form, the tragicreversedrecapitulation
may be identifiedas a large-scale
hyberbaton. Indeed, the Baroque musical rhetoricianJohann Adolph
Scheibe identifies hyberbatonas "the removal of... [a] musical idea
from the expected order"(Buelow 1980, 794).
In employing the term "deformation" connection with the tragic
in
reversedsonataform, I drawuponrecentworkof JamesHepokoski,who
defines sonata deformation as "a strikingly non-normativeindividual
structure,one that contravenessome of the most centraldefining traditions, or default gestures, of a genre while explicitly retainingothers"
(Hepkoski 1992, 143). The point of referenceis "thenormativepractice,
or set of reified defaults,urgedby the Formenlehre
traditions,for better
or worse a fundamentalframe of reference for the institutionof Germanicartmusic at least fromthe time of A. B. Marxon" (Hepkoski1993,
6-7).
The tragicreversedsonataform as a deformationof normativesonata
form has a different pedigree and significance from the symmetrical
sonata form of the early classical period (c.1740-80).6 Early classical
64

sonatasin symmetricalsonataform incorporatethe reversedrecapitulation as a stable, symmetricalformation.Symmetricalsonataform is not
a deformationof normativesonataform, andthe tonic at the beginningof
the recapitulation usually real ratherthan displaced or apparent.Exis
are
amples of the symmetricalrecapitulation found in JohannStamitz's
symphoniesfrom 1740 through1750, althoughthis formaldispositionis
less common in Stamitz's music than generally believed (Wolf 1981).
Some twelve worksby Haydnfeaturesymmetricalrecapitulations.
Mark
Evan Bonds remarks that "this procedure is largely abandonedafter
1770,"observing how, "it is all the more strikingthat Mozartabandons
the procedure[of the reversedrecapitulation] suddenlyand at almost
so
precisely the same time as Haydn" (Bonds 1988; 287, 301-2).7 After
about 1770, reversingthe recapitulation

of the firstmovementsof Mozart'sPiano Sonata,K. 311 (1777) andViolin Sonata, K. 306 (1778) show that Mozarthad not entirely abandoned
the earlierformal practice.Both of these works were composed during
the composer'stripto Mannheimand Paris,and so perhapsexhibit local
influences. Indeed, French composers had a penchantfor symmetrical
sonataform well into the nineteenthcentury.Cherubiniemploys it in his
overtureto Anacreon(1803), as does Berlioz in the firstmovementof the
SymphonieFantastique(1828), Harold in Italy (1834).,and the Overture
to Benvenuto Cellini (1838).8 Perhaps influenced by French models,

The genre of the tragicreversedsonataform stands,for the most part,
in starkcontrastto the "dark-to-light" "strife-to-victory"
or
model. In the
narrative
plots of pieces examinedbelow, the cruel blows of Destiny are
neverovercome as they are, for example,in Beethoven'sFifth and Ninth
Symphonies, Schumann'sSecond Symphony,and Tchaikovsky'sFifth
Symphony(Newcomb 1984; Kraus 1991). In the repertoireof works in
the tragicreversedsonataform, thereis no rescue, no Deus ex machina,
no song of rejoicing.
Technical Aspects of Design-Structure Correlation
Beach (1993) succinctly explains the essential distinctionfirst made
a
by Felix Salzer between "design"and "structure," distinction which
will be assumed throughoutthe presentdiscussion. In view of the cencortralityof the frequentlycomplex, even contrapuntal
design-structure
relation in sonata form, it is surprisinghow little has appearedon this
subject.As is well known, Schenker'spioneeringdiscussion of the structures underlyingsonata design in Free Compositiondoes not constitute
65

an exhaustiveinventoryof the structural design possibilities of sonata
or
form, a deficiency which Ostersought to remedyin his notes and addendum (Schenker 1979, 133-40). Schenkerremarkscrypticallythat "even
a reorderingof the original sequence of the materialis possible in the
since the fundamental
line and the bass arpeggiation
ultirecapitulation,
mately restorethe balance"(Schenker1979, 138).
More recently,a numberof distinguishedanalysts have begun to fill
in some of the many gaps in Schenkerand Oster'spublishedaccountof
sonataform. Beach (1993), for example, has studiedsubdominant
recapitulations in Schubert. Sonatas with subdominantrecapitulationsand
sonataswith reverseddesigns may be genericallyrelatedinsofaras both
avoid an expected structural
tonic at the beginningof the recapitulation,
and both replace interruptionwith an undivided Urlinie. Schachter's
in
(1991, 250-51) analysis of the WIII
recapitulation the Finale of Schubert's Ninth Symphony also sheds light on the problem of Schubert's
off-tonic recapitulations.
More generally,JackAdrian'sdetailed studies
of sonata form systematically explore some of the territory already
mappedout by Schenkerand Oster (Adrian 1990a; 1990b). Building on
Oster's addendum,
Adriandefines the ternarysonataform as a sonatain
which the initial structural
tonic supportingthe Kopftonreturnstwice in
the course of the sonata:at the beginningof the developmentsection and

tain three, rather than the customary two, "structural
downbeats,"as
definedby Morgan(1969). Accordingto Adrian,this repertoire
includes
the firstmovementsof Brahms'sViolin Sonatain G MajorOp. 78 (187879), Piano Trio in C Major Op. 87 (1880), Fourth Symphony Op. 98
(1884-85), andClarinetSonataOp. 120, No. 2 (1894). As I arguebelow,
however,the first movementof Brahms'sFourthSymphonyis a special
tonic supporting primarytone does not apthe
case, in thatthe structural
pear at the real beginning of the recapitulation(m. 259) but is instead
reservedfor the onset of the coda (m. 394) in the partiallyreversedsonata
form.9
Let us now examinevariousways in which dislocationof the standard
sonata design in reversed sonata form may influence large-scale tonal
structure.Tragedy is representednot simply by reversingthe order of
but
groups in the recapitulation, by tonal displacementof the tonic norassociated with the beginning of the recapitulation.Figuratively
mally
speaking,the cruelhandof Destiny upsets not only the sonatadesign, but
also destroys or distortsthe expected harmonic-tonal
structure.In some
examples of tragicreversedsonataform,reversingthe orderof groupsin
the recapitulationinvolves displacing the recapitulatedsecond group's
tonic by a more background
chord, sometimes by a prolongeddominant
extending forwardout of the development.As a result of this dominant
extension, the definitivereturnof the tonic (with its associatedstructural
66

downbeat) does not coincide with the returnof the second group, but
ratheris saved for the culminatingrecapitulation the firstgroup.10

Tracingthe genreof tragicreversedsonataformthroughtwo centuries
connoexposes a complex networkof overlappingand interpenetrating
tations.Thus,when Haydn,Mozartor Brahmsemploy the genre,the plasticity of their treatmentrings variationsupon its inheritedsignificances.

deviations.The reversedsonata form of the Andante from Beethoven's

as a model for his Quartettsatz 1820, prompted B. Marxto describe

it as "seltsam fremd" (Kerman 1967, 149). Schubert's Quartettsatz
(which Brahmsowned in manuscript)
may have providedBrahmswith a
formal model for four tragic works in reversedsonataform: the Finales
of the first Cello Sonatain E minor,Op. 38 (1866) and the ThirdViolin
Sonatain D minor,Op. 108 (1889), the Schicksalslied,Op. 54 (1868-71),
and the TragicOverture,Op. 81 (1881).13
If some interpreters
have misread the design of works in reversed
sonata form, this may be in part because the form has not been recognized as a legitimate genre. Donald FrancisTovey regardsinstances of
reversedsonatadesign in Cherubinias evidence of a "deficientsense of
had
form,"observingrhetoricallyand yet paradoxicallythat "Cherubini
a very good sense of form; he was profoundly moved by Haydn and
Mozart,nor did Beethoven fail to influence him more than he liked to
admitto himself. But his treatment the Vienneseformsresultsonly by
of
a precariousseries of flukes in anythingthatcan be judged by the same
criteria"(Tovey 1989a, 173). Furthermore, relationshipbetween rethe
versed sonata design and undividedtonal structurein this repertoireis
frequentlycomplex, and so can easily provokeconfusing, even contradictory analyses. Too often, the source of ambiguitylies more with the
analyst than the composer.For example, contraryto Coren's (1974) assertion of "ambiguity[my emphasis] in Schubert'srecapitulations,"
the
in
relationshipbetween design and tonal structure Schubertis generally
complex but unambiguous.
The Second Group over Dominant Prolongation
The most common way of composing the second group'srecapitulation in the reversed sonata form is to continue dominantprolongation
throughthe returnof the second group.An initialexampleis providedby
the Finale of Haydn's Symphony No. 44. Recompositionof the bridge
section (mm. 112-137) leads directly into the recapitulation the secof
ond group (ex. la). Displacement of the tonic in the recapitulationis
taken a step furtherby convertingthe expected tonic in m. 151 into a V
of IV. The chromaticvoice-exchangein the developmentis then recomposed (m. 158) leadinginto an extensionof the dominant,which prepares
the definitive tonic return.The arrivalon the structural
tonic (m. 175)
coincides with the returnof the firstgroup'smaterial,which doubles as a
coda. The large-scale5-6-5 neighbornote 'x,' which spans exposition,
of
development,and recapitulation the second group, constitutesan enlargementof the motive presentedby the subject(exs. la-b).

In the Finale of Brahms'sFirst Cello Sonata,the dominantprolongation is extendeddeeperinto the reversedrecapitulation
thanin any of the
previous examples (ex. 5a). In the Cello Sonata, the definitivetonic returnis displaced beyond the recapitulation the second group into the
of
middle of the recapitulation the first group.The first group is a fugal

expositioncontainingthe subjectin the tonic at mm. 1-4 with the answer
at the dominantin mm. 5-9. Brahmsachieves the extraordinary
effect of
of
continuingthe dominantprolongationthroughrecapitulation the first
group (m. 132ff.) by an astonishinglysimple device: he omits the initial
four-measure
tonic statementof the subjectso thatthe recapitulation
bewith the answeron the dominant.AlthoughBrahmsthen restatesin
gins
mm. 132-58 the contents of mm. 5-31 virtuallyunchanged,these measures are tonally revaluedin the larger context. Whereas in the exposition, the tonic at mm. 1-4, 9-12, 16-19, and 25 is structural,in the
this
recapitulation same tonic is caughtwithin continuingdominantprolongation;its function in the latercontext is to supporta passing tone E
in the uppervoice (m. 136) on its way up to F (m. 158).
The middlegroundof this work grows out of two essential motivic
ideas containedin the fugue subject:the ascendingthird,motive 'x'; and
the octave leap, motive 'y' (ex. 5b). Enlargements 'x,' sometimesfilled

In the Schicksalslied(ex. 6a), Brahmsmodifies reversedsonataform
by omitting the first group from the recapitulation.
Implicit in reversed

charactersin the Quartetfind themselves caughton a treadmillof tragic
destiny, since a solution to the conundrumhas not yet presenteditself.
Although Brahms sacrifices the recapitulationof the first group in the
Schicksalslied,the idea of circularityimplied by the reversedsonatadesign is intensifiedthereby redeploymentof the introductionas a coda.17
Two recent analyses of the Schicksalsliedby Luhring(1985) and Daverio (1993) concur in their interpretation the design as a "double
of
sonata form."18
Both analysts regardthe setting of the first two stanzas
(mm. 29-96) as a sonatain E; linked by a transitionto the setting of the
third stanza, a second sonata in C minor.In this interpretation, first

Accordingto the alternative
mal-tonalanalysis proposedin ex. 6a, however,Luhringand Daverio's
firstsonataconstitutesthe firstgroupof a single reversedsonataform.
This firstgroup(mm. 29-96) is a strophicbinarydesign AB/AB'. The
poem's initial two stanzas are composed of six and nine lines respectively. The strophicdesign of the setting parallelsthe poem's design, as
A and A' set the firstfour and six lines of each stropherespectively,and

strophesinto antecedantand consequent.
Both Luhringand Daverio describe the second sonata as being in C
minor,readinga move from I to V in its exposition (mm. 104-79). However, my analysisin ex. 6c shows thatBrahmsneverestablishesthe tonic
in this section; instead,the key of C minoris suggestedby prolongingits
dominant,G.19As shown in the analyticalgraphs (exs. 6c-d), the tonic
chords in mm. 113, 128, and 210-50 are trappedwithin middleground

grows out of the earlier

The Second Group over Submediant Prolongation
Schubert'sbold and imaginativeprojectionof the reversedrecapitulation over IVII
could have deeply impressedBrahms,who owned the manof the Quartettsatz,
and urgedits publicationin 1870. The comuscript

The Finale of Brahms'sThirdViolin Sonataprovides
a further
remarkable
exampleof reversedsonataform;in this case the second groupis recapitulated
over VI.
If analystshave debatedwhetherto describethis Finale as a sonataor
rondo, their differences may be ascribedto the movement's especially
correlation. unpublished
An
complex design-structure
analysispreserved
in the Oster Collection reveals that Schenker(1920b, 279-82) regarded
the form as a seven-partrondo "afterthe Mozarteanmodel,"as follows:
"Al- (mm. 1-38, in D minor)B1- (mm. 39-112, in A minor)A2- (mm.
114-29, in D minor) C1- (mm. 130-71, moving from G minor through
B6minor,C#minorto F minor)A3- (mm. 172-217, F minorto D major)
B2- (mm. 218-92, D minor)A4 (coda, mm. 293-end, D minor)."This
undatedanalysis is probablyquite early, predating1923. In an analysis
published in the early thirties, Edwin Evans offers both a rondo interpretationsimilar to Schenker'sand a sonata analysis in which the recapitulation of the first group begins in m. 172 (Evans 1935, 241-42).
However,Evans seems uncomfortablewith his own sonataanalysis, esthat
pecially with locating the returnin m. 172, remarking "theslight reference to firstsubjectat the return(or thirdrondosection as the case may
be) is a feature almost amountingto omission of the theme."Perhapsa
more compelling, rondo interpretation
would assimilate Schenker'sand
Evans's second return(mm. 172-213) within a largerC (mm. 130-217)
to yield a six-partrondo form:ABACBA.
Is the returnof the opening materialin mm. 114-29 the firstreturnin
a rondoor a reminiscence,which initiatesa sonatadevelopment?Designating the first groupA, the second group B, and the developmentC, it
becomes clear thatthe five-partreversedsonataformABCBA is related,
at least outwardly,to the six-partrondo formABACBA. Furthermore,
if
the composermakes referenceto the opening (A) at the beginningof the
development-a common procedurein sonata forms-reversed sonata
form can easily become confused with rondo. Mitschka (1961, 280)
identifiestheViolin Sonata'sFinale as being in sonataformwithoutcommentingon the orderof the groupsin the recapitulation.

Different concepts, however,underly the reversed sonata and rondo
forms. In sonata form (with both regularand reversedrecapitulations),
the exposition is characterizedby polarity between groups, which are
distinguishedby key, thematic content, and general mood. Exposition
and recapitulatioh
counterbalance another,the boundariesand mateone
rials of each group generallybeing preservedin the recapitulation,
even
if orderis reversedand certainmodificationsare made to accommodate
tonal structure.In rondo, the returnsof A serve as goals of tonal action,
separatedby recurrencesof B and C, which function as intervening
episodes. If the opening material(A) returnsat the beginningof the defor
velopment in a sonata,it serves as a point of departure the development (C) ratherthan as a goal. A furtherdistinction between the two
forms concerns the subsequenttreatmentof the second groupin the sonataand the firstepisode in the rondo.Essentialto the sonataidea is that
the recapitulation the second groupbe rigorouslymodeled on the secof
ond group in the exposition, preservingits polaritywith the first group.
In the rondo,on the otherhand,the recurrence B materialis potentially
of
freerin its recapitulation.
It is informativeto comparethe firstreturnin the Finale of Brahms's
Violin Concerto-a genuine six-part rondo form (ABACBA+Coda)with the reminiscenceof the openingat the beginningof the development
in the Violin Sonata'sFinale. In the concerto-rondo, firstreturn(mm.

114-17 differs from mm. 1-4, furtherweakeningthe rondoeffect.
In my view, then, the Violin Sonata'sFinale is a reversedsonataform
ratherthan a rondo, the first groupbeing recapitulated mm. 293-330
in
afterthe second groupin mm. 216-292 (ex. 8a). Trueto the sonataprinciple, Brahmsrecapitulatesthe second group exactly. This group (mm.
37-113) is subdividedas a small ternaryform-A at mm. 37-76, B at
mm. 77-103, A' at mm. 104-13 (ex. 8b)-and is recapitulated
note-fornote at mm. 216-92. The first group (mm. 1-30) is a small binaryform
composedof two sections supported an auxiliaryV-Icadence:A (mm.
by
1-16) on the dominant,and B (mm. 17-30) on the tonic. This small form
is recapitulated
afterthe second group,with A at mm. 293-310 and B at
mm. 311-30. The bridge from the exposition (mm. 31-36), which prepares the returnof the second group in mm. 210-15, is attachedto the
retransition mm. 194-209. The modified returnof the opening (mm.
at
114-29) may be interpretedplausibly as a reminiscence initiating the
development.The form of development(mm. 114-93) is thus described
as follows: varied reminiscence of the opening (part 1, mm. 114-29),
fantasy on materialfrom the first and second groups (part2, mm. 13071), and contrapuntal
developmentof first group material(part 3, mm.
172-93).
The analyticalsketches furthershow the complex and unusualinterrelationshipbetweenreversedsonataform andundividedtonal structure.
Major junctures in design do not invariablycoincide with harmonic
points of arrival.For example, the first group and its recapitulation
provide a clear instance of harmonic-structural
overlap. The design of the
firstgroup(mm. 1-30) straddlesa V-I cadence.When this groupis recapitulated (mm. 293-330), the initial auxiliary dominant becomes the

the design recapitulation the first group continuespast this structural
of
coda to m. 330. The design coda begins only afterthe generalpause in m.
331. In this case, design lags behind structure.From a structuralperfor
spective, the mainpoint of departure the developmentis the subdominant (m. 130), while a design perspectivewould have the development
initiatedearlier(m. 114), with the variedrecollectionof the opening. In
this case, design outpaces structure.
These design-structural
"misunderstandings"may be partof the purely musical tragedyembodied in this
impassionedwork.
Before leaving the Finaleof the ThirdViolin Sonata,a further
unusual
aspect of the work requirescomment.The listeneris struckby the direct
octaves statedby the violin and piano (bass) as the A chord supporting

4
(m. 129) moves down to the G chord supporting (m. 130). As already
noted, the A chordin the second group(mm. 92-107) is to be understood
as the upperthirdof F (III),ratherthanas a definitivearrivalon the dominant of D. (The structuraldominant in the undivided backgroundis
saved for m. 293.) Thus, these octaves are amelioratedby correctvoiceleading in the backgroundas the F chord (III, m. 37) ascends to the G
chord (IV, m. 130). In spite of this background
justification,the surface
octaves are particularlystrikingand, to my ears, hardly "beautiful,"
to
use Brahms'stermof approbation octaves in his collection of octaves
for
in other composers' music (Mast 1980; Laudon 1992). Is their harsh,
even sullen affect also connectedwith the work's tragiceffect?
The Second Group within a Large-scale 5-6 Exchange
The complex interaction reversedsonatadesign and tonal structure
of
in Brahms's TragicOverturehas presentedserious challenges to analysis. Webster(1983, 111) proposes that the form of this work is an oversonata-rondo,
ABA, and ritorello
lay of "sonata-without-development,
However,
principles, even though the sonata idea remains paramount."
by simultaneouslyidentifying so many differentschemes, Websterobscures importantdistinctions among the designs invoked and blurs the
reversedsonata'designof Brahms'scomposition.Websterobserves that
Brahms omits the first group at the beginning of the recapitulation
(m. 300ff.) without recognizing Brahms'sbroaderdesign strategy.The

both as the dominantof the subdominant,ensnaredwithin the large-scale 5-6 exchange over the pro(ex. 9a), and as the tonic major(ex. 9b); this struclonged subdominant

Brahms modifies reversedsonata form in two importantlate works,
the first movementsof his FourthSymphonyand C minorTrio. In both

compositions,the opening of the recapitulation suppressedand shifted
to the beginningof the coda. This design is only partiallyreversed,since
the initial partof the first group is placed after the recapitulation the
of
second group.In conjunctionwith the design displacement,the returnof
the structural
tonic supportingthe Kopftonis shifted from the beginning
of the recapitulation the beginningof the coda (exs. 1la and 12a).The

has been writtenregardingthe motivic significance of the falling third

pecially in his late works.32 the motivic substanceof this movement
is derived primarilyfrom the fifth-descending and ascending, perfect

5-6-5 exchangein the background
grows naturally of
the first theme, which comprises two descending fifths, perfect ('a-p5')
and diminished('a-?5'), separatedby a sixth (ex. 12b). The inversionof
the initialfifth,filled in chromatically,
forms a significantmotive,labeled
'x' on ex. 12c ('x' = 'a-p5i'). Brahms calls attentionto the inversional
relationship between 'a' and 'x' at the outset, as B-G-E ('a,' m. 1)
becomes E-G-B ('x,' m. 5). Overlappingenlargementsand diminutions
of 'x' are exhibitedin ex. 12d, spanningboth Tovey's "cloudy,mysterious" chordsat mm. 358-62 and the fanfaremotive at mm. 363-71 in the

Almost certainly,Germancomposersdid not deliberatelyset out to compose Aristoteliannotions of tragedyor figures of ancientGreek linguistic rhetoricinto theirtragicworks.34
Rather,the thinkingof these masters
was subtly conditioned by ancient ideas of drama and expression. As

In the Quartetfrom Mozart'sIdomeneo,the Overtureto Cherubini's

of the "tragic"significance of the reversed recapitulationcan be supportedwith referenceto the plot or program.On his way back from the

NOTES
1. Rosen (1988, 286) takes note of the reversed recapitulation only in passing. Webster (1978, 19) includes a bibliography of studies of sonata form to 1978; Wolf
(1966) and Kamien (1976) are devoted to the recapulation.
2. I am indebted to discussions of form in the writings of Felix Salzer, Saul Novack,
Carl Schachter, and James Hepokoski.
3. For example, the Finale of Bruckner's Seventh Symphony (see my forthcoming,
"The Finale of Bruckner's Seventh Symphony"). I have not identified any further
examples of the reversed three-group recapitulation exhibiting other possible permutations of the three groups.
4. Jackson (1995a) offers a detailed discussion of Tchaikovsky's use of this form in
the TempestOverture and the first movement of the Fourth Symphony.
5. Shakespeare, Othello, Act 5, Scene 2, Line 3. On Shakespeare's use of the "vices
of language," and of hyberbaton in particular,see Joseph (1947, 54-56).
6. I prefer to identify this early classical reversed recapitulation as "symmetrical
sonata form," thereby eliminating the term "reversed" with its connotation of
"deformation."The reversed recapitulation is also essentially different from palindrome, in which the musical materials themselves are retrograded;see Newbould
(1992) and Dalen (1989) for recent discussions of palindrome in Schubert and
Berg.
7. The interested reader may wish to examine these works listed by Bonds, which
include: the symphonies, 21/11 (1764), 31/I (1765), 59/IV (1766-68), 44/IV (c.
1770), 87/IV (1785); and the string quartets, Op. 1/1/III (1755-59), Op. 2/6/
(1755-59), Op. 50/3/1 (1787), Op. 71/2 (1793).
8. In the Symphonie Fantastique, symmetrical sonata form (identified by Schumann
in his famous review) has a very special programmatic significance, the effort to
secure the tonic in the recapitulation being programmatically connected with the
attempt to concretize the dream-image of the beloved. See my forthcoming "The
Finale of Bruckner's Seventh Symphony."
9. Adrian claims a tonic returnat the beginning of the recapitulation in the first movement of the Fourth Symphony. Another example of ternary sonata form not mentioned by Adrian is the slow movement of Bruckner's Sixth Symphony ( 1879-81).
Interestingly, Brahms and Bruckner independently first explored the ternary
sonata form at roughly the same time, 1878-81.
10. Thus, this article and Morgan's dissertation are related. Morgan is primarily concerned with non-reversed sonata designs in which the returnof the structuraltonic
with its associated structuraldownbeat is delayed. This study probes the delay of
the structural downbeat resulting from the postponed recapitulation of the first
group in the reversed sonata form.
11. This connotation is not intrinsic to reversed sonata form, but context-dependent.
One would be hard pressed to consider as "tragic" the first movement of Schubert's "Trout"Quintet, which also has an undivided Urlinie (Beach 1993).
12. Although Cherubini was trained in Italy and later resided and worked in France,
his essentially classical language is so close to that of late Haydn and Mozart, and
middle period Beethoven, that he may be included in the present discussion of the
"Germanclassical tradition."
13. Reversed sonata form is also employed in Liszt's Les Preludes (1848), the Finales

103

of Bruckner's String Quintet (1879) and Seventh Symphony (1883), the Finale of
Mahler's Sixth Symphony (1904), the first movement of Schoenberg's Second
String QuartetOp. 10 (1907, see my forthcoming, "The Finale of Bruckner's Seventh Symphony"), the Finale of Sibelius's FourthSymphony Op. 63 (1909, see my
forthcoming, "The Meta-Ursatz"), and the the first movement of Tchaikovsky's
Fourth Symphony Op. 36 (1877, see Jackson 1995a).
14. Heartz (1980, 239) misreads the formal design of the Quartet and its large-scale
harmonic structure. Following the repetition of the text beginning in m. 67, he
oversimplifies matters by dividing the design into two parts, mm. 1-67 and 67end.
15. For a critique of Kerman's naive "analysis" of the development, see Mitchell
(1967).
16. The prolongational strategy is established in the second group (mm. 40-42, ex.
4c).
17. Schubert in "Am Meer" from Schwanengesang similarly reuses the introduction
as coda to represent tragic circularity.
18. Daviero's study is the more wide-ranging, but his conclusions about the work's
form and meaning are remarkably similar to Luhring's.
19. Schachter (1987) explores techniques of suggesting a key without prolonging its
tonic.
20. Programmatically, mankind tries to reverse this fall in mm. 298-332 by converting "fallen" Fb(14) into "redeemed"E (#3, ex. 6a), but is pulled back into the mire
with D# (#2) falling as E (3), through D; ('2) to C (1). For the religious significance of enharmonic transformation,see Jackson (1990a; 1990b, 121-22; 1995b,
63-64; 1995c, 97).
21. Bruce (1969) had already identified the reversed recapitulation in the Quartettsatz,
although he believed the work to contradict the sonata style in its largertonal organization. The subdivision of the second group into three sections was observed by
Westrup (1969, 29).
22. Coren (1974, 576) comes close to identifying reversed sonata form, observing
that "it is possible, when one looks back over the movement, to understandeverything from the returnof the secondary theme at measure 195 to the end as a recapitulation with the primary material displaced to the closing bars." However, he
discounts the possibility that the opening may function both as a coda and recapitulation of the first group, asserting that the music of mm. 305-end is "not
left-over recapitulatory material."In the end, Coren rejects the reversed recapitulation as "working on paper" but going "against the psychological effect of the
piece." Instead, he hears the development continuing through the return of the
secondary theme, with the precise beginning of the recapitulation remaining
"ambiguous."
23. Unlike Bruce (1969), I do not regard mm. 93-140 as a third group. Whether one
reads a two or three group exposition does not affect a reading of the tonal structure, however. If mm. 93-140 constitute a third group, then the recapitulation
exhibits the irregularorder, second group, third group, followed by first group. I
find it more elegant to view mm. 93-140 as part of the second group, so that the
recapitulation is simply reversed, with the second group following the first.
24. The topos in this piece, as in so many other tragic works by Schubert, is "confrontation with death in midst of life," the soul's mournful reaction to mortality

104

represented by the basso lamento or descending tetrachord. On this point, see
Jackson (1991, 348), Schwarmath (1969), and Rosand (1979).
25. The first theme of the second group beginning in A; major (VI) in m. 27 does not
occur over a structuralharmony or Stufe occupying its own harmonic-durational
space. Rather, as shown in the analytical sketch, Al is caught within a prolongation of the initial tonic, which moves to the dominant of the dominant in m. 91. A
chromaticized voice exchange (involving C#, EN, E) leads from the initial tonic
and
(m. 1) to the dominant of the dominant (m. 81). As shown in ex. 7a, the voice
exchange creates a chromatic line in both outer voices, C (m. 1)-C# (m. 81)-D (m.
91). This chromatic line (labeled 'x') is then recomposed through the development, as D; (m. 157) is enharmonically converted into C# (m. 182). The bass from
the opening through the beginning of the recapitulation is organized in unfolded
thirds, the ascending third C (m. 1)-E; (m. 182) answered by the descending third
D(m. 183)-Bb (m. 195).
I have benefited from Beach's (1994, 13-17) bass graph of the Quartettsatz.
Beach, like Webster, hears G prolonged through mm. 77-93. As is apparentfrom
my graph and accompanying remarks, I attach greater significance than Beach to
the linear progression C-C#-D (my motive 'x') in the exposition, which I hear
recomposed through the development in the manner described above.
26. Harmonically, this apparent dominant chord (mm. 118-29) is not further stabilized (ex. 8a-b): instead, as the graphs show, it is a back-relating sonority, dependent on the F major triad of mm. 40ff. as its upper third.
27. Webster mistakes this varied recapitulation of the first group for the onset of the
coda, which he takes too soon at m. 379. Mitschka (1961, 228), like Webster, does
not recognize that mm. 367-403 represent the recapitulation of the first group.
Mitschka thus completely overlooks the reversed sonata design and, like Webster,
takes the coda too soon. He regards the coda as beginning in m. 367, even earlier
than Webster.In my view, the coda spans mm. 404-22 and is unusual insofar as it
constitutes an interpolation within the final descent 2-1, ratherthan the customary
elaboration of 1 (see the parentheses in ex. 9c). Like many earlier analysts, Webster believes that the Tragic Overture is in some kind of sonata form; Spies (1983,
391-98), on the other hand, claims that sonata form per se is a "fiction" and that,
in the Tragic Overture, Brahms recapitulates segments of earlier material to
"restore deluded confidence to believers in 'form,' and to appear to resolve ambiguity for sceptics."
28. Morgan (1969, 64-69) asserts that "the recapitulation of the opening cadential
chords [.. .] has mistakenly been called a subdominant reprise." Morgan's bass
graph suggests that the subdominant in the development functions as a lower
neighbor to a structuraldominant reached as early as m. 72 and prolonged until m.
228 (see also Mozart, Piano Sonata in C Major, K.545, first movement, where the
reprise is supportedby a subdominant neighbor to the prolonged dominant). In my
view, however, the structure of Beethoven's Coriolan Overture is essentially different. As ex. 9 suggests, the prolonged subdominant is here a fundamental harmony or Stufe, rather than a neighbor chord to the dominant. This subdominant
prolongation initiated in the development may extend through the recapitulation
(ex. 9b) and even deep into the coda (ex. 9a). Perhaps this massive subdominant
prolongation has programmaticsignificance. Just as Coriolanus is prevented from
