NOTES
1. This apparenttautology("doublecounterpointin two voices") is actually a necessary
specification;in the course of this article I will touch upon some double counterpoints
which occur in three-voicedmusic.
2. It is, of course, possible to place a "double-counterpoint-of-a-double-counterpoint"
(A
over B changedto B over A changedback to A over B) at a differentpitch level than
the original A over B arrangement.This correspondsto a transposedrepetitionof A
over B and is more often heardas such ratherthanas a double counterpoint B over
of
A. A more complicatedsituationarises when the "transposedrepetition"is inverted
at an intervalthatmakesthe registraldistancebetweenthe two partsdifferentfrom that
found in the original passage. Besides the differencein registralspace, such a change
can also create voice-crossingsnot foundin the originalor, alternately,
eliminatesuch
voice-crossings, therebychanging slightly the shape of the musical foreground.
3. This notation is differentthat that used in standardtexts on group theory, where A,
is
B, and C are displayedhorizontallyand the permutation writtenbelow it. My notation better reflectsthe standardnotationalarrangement contrapuntal
of
lines in registral space and will be useful when discussing examples of triple counterpointsin
music. A useful referencework that discusses permutationgroups is WalterLedermann, Introductionto the Theoryof Finite Groups(New York:IntersciencePublishers, 1957), pp. 62-95.
4. Figure 3b shows the multiplicationof the same two permutationsY and Z in noncyclic notation.
5. The other requirementfor group structure,that the combinationof permutationsbe
associative, is also satisfied, but cannot be seen at once by inspecting the Table.
6. It is sometimes more profitableanalytically to describe invertible counterpointsof
three-partmusic in just this way. For instance, Bach'sorgan sonatas-like others of
his trio sonatas-are conceived as two treble voices and a bass. The uppertwo parts
are often invertedunderpermutation B) while the continuo-likeline C in the bass
(A
is left untouched.The techniqueis used, for example, in SonataI BWV 525, I, mm.
1-4 and mm. 22-25; Sonata VI BWV 530, I, mm. 21-28 and mm. 29-36.
and
7. "Cyclic notation" "cyclicgroup"are completelydifferentideas; the first is a notathe
tional convenienceused with permutations, second is a special propertyof certain
groups. Because subgroupH is both

UniversityPress, 1986), p. 183. Lewin develops a more formaldefinitionof isography
in pp. 193-201.
11.This situationwas presentedas an abstractionin Figure 5 and 6.
12. It is importantto remindthe readerthat our permutationsas definedoperateon thematic tokens (line) A, B, C, etc., not on registral tokens like "top," "middle,"and

48

"bottom."Thus (A B) changes line A to line B and line B to line A, in whateverregisters the two lines appear; in contrasta registrallydefined permutation,such as (top
middle), would exchange the melodic lines of the top and middle voices, whatever
those lines happenedto be. (Top middle) is thus not a member of our permutational
system as we have developed the system. Nevertheless the pertinenceof the registral
permutationsis clear in connection with the presenttext. In additionto this important
distinction between thematic and registralpermutations,I should also point out here
thatother musical dimensionscan be represented tokensA, B, and C. For instance,
by
the tokens could representthree instruments,or two manuals and pedal on an organ.
the
All that is needed is some musical dimension which "separates" three lines.
13. The only time outside the exposition that the theme appearswithoutany of the seconversion of the principal
dary countersubjects-and indeed, without a straightforward
countersubject-is in mm. 71-75.
14. Althoughthe thematicimpressionof this section is like that of an exposition, the section does not conform to the harmonic requirementof an exposition (the entries are
for
on V, I, and VI), and the use of differentsecondarycountersubjects each thematic
entrance somewhat obscures the relationshipof this section to the exposition.
15. The triple counterpointis not exact throughouteach section. The conjugationalrelationship can thus best be seen in a few, relatively exact portions, viz. mm. 223-233,
mm. 275-285, mm. 337-347.
16. The D-major Sinfonia is the only composition in the collection that uses all six possible arrangementsof triple counterpoint.
17. Friedrich Wilhelm Marpurgrecognized the basic idea of conjugationalgrouping in
