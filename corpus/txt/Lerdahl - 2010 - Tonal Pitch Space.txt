Models of pitch space have been developed in music psychology to
account for perceived proximity among pitches, chords, or regions. This
article introduces a different model that (1) treats pitches, chords, and
regions within one framework, (2) correlates with the experimental data,
and (3) connects in interesting ways with a variety of music theories.

Introduction
A numberof cognitivepsychologists,notably Longuet-Higgins
(1962/
1987) and Shepard(1982), haveproposedtheoriesof tonal pitchrelations

1. As Weber (1824) was well-known to German and Austrian musicians throughout the
nineteenth century, we can surmise that Schoenberg was aware of Weber's space but did not
bother to attribute it. Schoenberg (1954) was designed not as a theoretical treatise but as a
textbook, and it was assembled from notes after his death.

The connection can be explained through the distinction between a tonal
hierarchy and an event hierarchy (Deutsch, 1984; Bharucha, 1984a).
A tonal hierarchy is a nontemporal mental schema that listeners utilize in
assigning event hierarchies to pitch sequences. For example, listeners of
Classical music understand chromatic inflections within a diatonic framework, and they employ distance from the tonic on the circle of fifths in determining harmonic domination or subordination. Such schémas arise
from listening experience through the filter of our general musical cognitive
capacity. Exposure to a different musical idiom would lead to a different
tonal hierarchy. In addition- and this may be less obvious- a tonal hierarchy arises from the intrinsic organization of the pitch materials, such as described in Balzano (1982). For instance, the asymmetrical diatonic scale allows unambiguous "position-finding" (Browne, 1981) in a way that, say,
the whole-tone and octatonic scales do not; nor would the latter two scales
permit the gradual introduction of new pitch classes along the cycle of
fifths. The topological models mentioned above can be viewed as representations of the tonal hierarchy for Classical music, where superordinate elements appear near the referential center of a space and less stable elements
appear farther away from the center.
An event hierarchy, in contrast, is part of the structure that listeners infer
from temporal musical sequences. This kind of hierarchy has long been familiar in the music-theoretic literature (although the specifics vary significantly from theory to theory) and will not be dwelt upon here. GTTM
develops in detail two kinds of event hierarchies: time-span reduction,
which expresses the relative structuralimportance of events as heard within
rhythmic units; and prolongational reduction, which expresses recursive
patterns of tension and relaxation among events.
The tonal hierarchy- hence an implicit pitch space- appears in GTTM
in incomplete form under the rubric of verbally stated stability conditions.
The theory claims that listeners cannot infer complex event hierarchies
without having access to such conditions, which are the main source for
ranking the relative stability of events within embedded temporal regions.
These regions in turn derive directly or indirectly from the grouping and
metrical structures. Figure 1 illustrates schematically that the time-span reduction derives from the rhythmic components and the stability conditions,
and the prolongational reduction derives from the time-span reduction and
the stability conditions. In short, both a rhythmic framework and criteria
for pitch stability are needed if the listener is to hear events in a dominatingsubordinating manner.
These remarks suggest, incidentally, that tonal and event hierarchies are
interdependent developmentally. Exposure to real music is a prerequisite
for internalizing a tonal schema, yet an event hierarchy cannot be con-

But the diatonic system is less symmetrical than these models suggest.
Note, for example, that the double helix in Figure 2 is made up of two
strands of whole-tone scales. Such a feature may be relevant to Debussy,
but it has nothing to do with diatonic tonal music, the subject of Shepard's
inquiry. Similarly, the major third cycle (as well as the minor third cycle)
begins to appear only in the course of nineteenth-century chromaticism, as
an alternative organizational principle to the diatonic system. Even the emphasis on the chromatic circle of fifths is suspect insofar as it causes neglect
of the equally fundamental but irregular diatonic circle of fifths, with its
single diminished fifth. A similar situation arises with Longuet-Higgin's
(1962/1987) space, shown in Figure 3, where the horizontal axis consists of
a fifth cycle and the vertical axis of a major third cycle. A third axis, not
shown, represents octave space. As with Shepard, the space is filled with
symmetrical interval cycles.2
2. Note that the diagonals yield semitone and minor third cycles (although LonguetHiggins is not directly concerned with this). Through a different route, Balzano (1982) arrives at an equivalent space, rotated so that the perfect fifth cycle rather than the minor third
cycle forms a diagonal. Unlike Balzano, Longuet-Higgins is much concerned with just intonation, a subject I prefer to avoid here.

3. The level of chord proximity within a region is in effect addressed in Piston (1941/
1978) in his "Table of Usual Root Progressions" (Chapter 3). A usual progression would be
between chords that are close in a spatial representation, an uncommon progression between spatially more distant chords. Also see the flow diagram in Werts (1983, Chapter 2),
which expresses similar relationships in another guise. Lewin (1987, Chapter 2) introduces
a space equivalent to that of Longuet-Higgins, but discusses it at the level of chord (root)
progression across regions rather than at the level of regions per se. He points out a precedent in Riemann (1893).
4. Exception must be made not only tor Longuet-riiggins but tor tne experimental work
of Krumhansland her associates, which has been clear about these distinctions. Her research
program, summarized in Krumhansl (1983), has proceeded from the level of pcs
(Krumhansl, 1979), to that of chords within a tonal region (Krumhansl, Bharucha, &
Kessler 1982), to that of tonal regions (Krumhansl & Kessler, 1982). As will be seen, much
of the following discussion relates to this work.

5. Deutsch and Feroe do not mention open-fifth space, but include a "seventh-chord
space" that would appear either between levels c and d of Figure 4 or as an extension within
level c. (I prefer the latter alternative; see Figure 16i below.) Seventh-chord space will mostly
be disregarded here, on the ground that in Classical music the interval of a seventh generally
behaves as a local dissonance governed by voice-leading principles. In consequence seventh
chords have little independent status. (For certain later styles- Wagner in his Tnstaw-chord
mode, Debussy and Ravel, jazz- it makes more sense to incorporate an independent
seventh-chord level.)

level of the hierarchy, and a skip is nonadjacent motion - two or more
steps- along any level.6
The notion of "step distance" makes sense only in terms of specific
pitches rather than of pcs. Assuming pitches 0 to 1 1 are contained within an
octave, the step distance of a pitch from pO ("pitch 0") can be calculated
horizontally at a number of levels. For example, p4 has a step value of 1 in
triadic space, 2 in diatonic space, and 4 in chromatic space. P6 has a step
value of 6 in chromatic space, but in the harmonic context of V/V- V-I it
has a value of 2: one step from 6 to 7, another step (at a higher level) from 7
to 1. Hence it is pointless to assign a fixed value for step distance comparable to the embedding distance in Figure 6, since step distance typically implicates chords and regions.
The ideas of embedding and step distance shed light on the musical treatment of consonance and dissonance. Given a certain orientation of the
space, more deeply embedded pitches are understood in terms of their adjacent superordinate context. Moving down in the space means increasing
dissonance, to be relieved by moving up again. Stepwise motion ensures the
coherence of these moves. If a skip to a more embedded pitch occurs, this
second pitch is located through subsequent stepwise motion to a third pitch
that in turn lies a step away from the first at a superordinate level.
CHORD PROXIMITYWITHIN A REGION

For the tonal hierarchy it is best to regard a chord (triad) as a Klang abstracted away from specific register or spacing (Riemann, 1893). Chords
are represented at level c in the space, with level b outlining the fifth in the
chord and level a supplying the root.
There are two factors in calculating the proximity of any two chords
within a tonal region: the diatonic circle of fifths and common tones. These
factors originate in the top two levels of the basic space. Both are familiar in
the music-theoretic literature. The circle-of-fifths factor is typically justified
on the ground that root motion by fifths is basic to cadences and is pervasive at all levels of tonal organization. (There are psychoacoustical and
group-theoretic justifications as well: the prominence of the third partial
and the traversal of the entire chromatic via the fifths cycle.) The common-

6. The step/skip idea, and indeed the whole question of musical space, became a preoccupation when I was working on prolongational "timbrai hierarchies"through digital synthesis (Lerdahl, 1987a). I found that timbrai stability conditions could not be realized without
constructing at least a two-dimensional array within which timbrai events "traveled." Perhaps there is an underlying "spatial" level of mental representation common to visual, musical (pitch and timbre), and even semantic understanding (Shepard& Cooper, 1982; Jackendoff, 1983).

323

Tonal Pitch Space

tone factor is justified on the ground that the sharing of pcs- of octave
space- is a strong associative link between two chords.
The diatonic circle-of-fifths operation takes place in triadic, open-fifth,
and octave space, leaving the content of diatonic space intact. The chordcircle rule can be stated as "move the pcs at levels a-c four diatonic steps to
the right or left (mod 12) on level d." For example, applying the rule once to
the right on I/I in Figure 5 produces Figure 7a. Applying the rule two and
three times to the right on I/I results in Figures 7b and 7c, respectively. (The
triad in Figure 7a is labeled V/I, or more simply as V; and so on.) The number of applications of the rule in any given instance measures the circle distance between two chords. Repeated application of the rule results in the
complete diatonic circle of fifths, shown in Figure 8 with only the pc numbers for chordal roots given. Note the diminished fifth between b and 5,
resulting from the two half steps at level d between b and 0 and between 4
and 5.
In an extension of the step/skip distinction, a step can be said to occur
between adjacent chords in Figure 8 and a skip between nonadjacent
chords. For example, a progression from I to V is a step, and a progression
from I to ii or from I to vi is a skip.

These shifts also cause pcs to return,formingcommon-tonerelationshipswith I. In Figure7, V has one commontone with I, ii has no common

concept of chordal step, for which we have so far had only a circle-of-fifths
account (Figure 8). In Figure 10 root motion by thirds is next in proximity
to motion by fifths {d = 7 as opposed to d = 5). These common-tone relationships can be used to generate a second axis, projecting the circle in Figure 12, where stepwise motion again takes place between adjacent chords.
Because of d's transpositional invariance, these steps can be made equidistant from one another, disregarding the major or minor quality of any particular third motion. (This equidistance is quite different from LonguetHiggin's major-thirds vector.)
Figure 13 combines the two circles in Figures 8 and 12. The vertical axis
represents the fifths circle and the horizontal axis the thirds circle. Since
both axes are circular, the topology for the space should be toroidal rather

than just two dimensional. (Imagine a piece of paper wrapped around in a
circle both horizontally and vertically at the same time.) The chords on the
horizontal axis are more widely spaced, reflecting the larger value for d for
chords a third apart. Diagonal "steps" are still larger and might be called
"chordal skips."
It may be objected that the values in Figure 10 from which Figure 13 derives do not adequately mirror real musical behavior. First of all, ii often
functions in its first inversion as a dominant-preparation voice-leading variant of IV, not as a "real" ii, in which case ; = 1 rather than 2. Second, to
avoid the diminished fifth between 5 and b, iii is often approached by rightward motion, in which case; = 4 rather than 3. This value would reflect the
typically greater remoteness (in major) of the harmonic as opposed to the
melodic third degree. Third, the characterization of vii° favors its behavior
in a circle-of-fifths sequence rather than its common voice-leading dominant function, in which latter case ; = 1 rather than 2 (since Rameau, vii°
has been characterized as a V7 with an absent fundamental). The revised
overall values for these chords would then be d{ii) = 1 + 6 = 7,
d(iii) = 4 + 4 = 8, and d(vii°) = 1 + 6 = 7. Alternative values for these
chords might be selected for different contexts.

But I would argue that chordal space need not directly reflect these voiceleading factors. Voice-leading belongs to event hierarchies, to which the
tonal hierarchy is not the sole input. I prefer to stick with the original values
for d if only because they permit the construction of the regular chordal
space of Figure 13, which has further uses below.
A second objection might be that Figures 10 and 13 depend on a formula
(d = ; + k) that compares, so to speak, apples and oranges. Why should the
steps on circle of fifths and the number of distinctive pcs combine in a simple additive fashion? Why not another formula, perhaps one that includes
constants (d = aj + bk) or some sort of vector analysis? These questions
continue below when a second circle-of-fifths rule is introduced; then there
will be two apples and one orange. In response, both here and below, I
merely point out that a simple additive model leads to attractive theoretical
results and (as will be seen) correlates with the experimental data. But probably a better quantification can be found.
CHORD PROXIMITYACROSS REGIONS

The next stage is to evaluate the distance between chords that are in different regions. We begin with regional shifts- that is, with changes in
diatonic collection.8 Distance is calculated by moving on the circle of fifths
at level d. The region-circle rule can be stated as "move the pcs at level d
seven chromatic steps to the right or left (mod 12) on level e." As shown in
Figure 14, applying the rule once to the right changes the C major diatonic
collection (Figure 14a) to the G major diatonic collection (Figure 14b). A
special feature of the diatonic system is that a move on the regional circle
causes just one pc change, and that this change is to an adjacent pç in chromatic space. Thus in Figure 14, pc5 shifts to pc6. The voice-leading ramifications of this feature are profound: a mere half-step alteration in a line
can change the listener's tonic orientation.
The number of applications of the region rule is one measure of the distance between two regions. Repeated application of the rule produces the
complete chromatic circle of fifths, shown in Figure 15 with only the roots
given. Analogous to Figure 8, regional stepwise motion can be thought of
provisionally in terms of adjacency on the chromatic circle.
It is important to see that a circle-of-fifths operation must apply at two
conceptual levels, once for chords within a region and once for regions. By
way of illustration, the distance from C major to C minor is 0 on the chord
8. Contrasting musical terminology is widely used for chromatic moves at different levels
of event hierarchies: "applied dominant" for momentary regional shifts, "tonicization" for
intermediate shifts, and "modulation" for global shifts. For present purposes these distinctions need be considered only as a matter of hierarchical level.

circle (Figure 8) but 3 on the region circle (Figure 15); conversely, the distance from C major to A minor is 3 on the chord circle but 0 on the region
circle. The parallel and relative minor are equally proximate to I/I, but in
opposite ways.
This example suggests enlarging the above formula for overall distance:
d(chord) = i + /"+ &,where/ = steps on the region circle and, as before,; =
steps on the chord circle and k = distinctive pcs. Until now i has always
been 0. The simplest way to calculate i is to count the number of changes in
flats and sharps in the key signature. To gauge chord-circle distance within
the new region, ; is calculated first to the new tonic and then from it. For
example, for iv/vi, the value for ; is not 2, as it would be directly from I/I
(iv/vi = ii/I). Instead, / = 3 + 1 = 4; that is, three circle steps up to vi and
one back to iv. The value for k will usually be larger than before because
distinctive pcs will now appear at the diatonic level as well. As above, this
formula is transpositionally invariant.
There is always a question as to how to treat the minor mode, which supposedly has three versions: the natural, harmonic, and melodic. It is better,
however, to view this matter only in terms of scale-degree voice-leading tendencies. The raised seventh degree appears as the leading-tone when rising
to the tonic, and as a result is part of V and vii° (it is not part of III, certain
harmony texts notwithstanding). A raised sixth happens only in voice-

inflection, the latter a reorientation often requiring careful preparation by
the composer.
The formula for d works for chords in nearby regions but often goes
awry for chords in more distant regions. One reason for this is that i counts
only circle-of-fifths relationships between regions. As with chordal space
(Figure 13), regional space must be enriched to include another axis. However, as we have seen, d varies both for the same chord in different regions
(Figure 16a-b, c-d) and for different chords within the same region (Figure
16f-g, h-i). It is necessary to address a more abstract level, that of the region as a whole.
REGIONAL PROXIMITY

Let us define the proximity of a secondary region simply in terms of the
distance of its local tonic. This step is justified because one strongly hears
chords in relation to their local tonic as well as to one overall governing
tonic. The distance of a local tonic is a simplified but salient indicator of the
distance of the region it represents.
Regional space can now be developed in the same way as toroidal
chordal space. First the local tonics are selected that have the smallest values for d. These are I/V, I/TV,i/vi, and i/i, for all of which d = 7 (although i,
/, and k differ for each; see Figure 16b, h, j, and k). The circle of fifths (I/V
is
and I/TV) placed on the vertical axis, and relative and parallel minor relationships (i/vi and i/i) on the horizontal axis. Then d is recursively transposed to generate two cycles, in fifths and minor thirds, together forming a
torus. Because d = 7 in all directions, the elements on this torus are equally
spaced, unlike the chordal torus. The result is Figure 17a. Figure 17b translates the note names of Figure 17a into Roman numerals, with "i/#ii" abbreviated as "jtii,"and so on, all oriented toward I/I.
Since the chordal and regional spaces are both projected by fifths and
thirds axes, the two spaces can be combined as in Figure 18. A fragment of
regional space is shown, and for each such region a representative portion
of chordal space is given. Each regional designation doubles for "I" or "i"
at the chordal level, for which various major/minor adjustments are also
made. Observe that the chordal pattern is repeated at a larger level in the
regional pattern. Moreover, the proximity of chords across regions emerges
directly in this representation. In I, for example, V is closest to V; conversely, in V, IV is closest to I (IV/V = I/I); and so on throughout the space,
horizontally and diagonally as well as vertically. This visualization is misleading only to the extent that, according to the calculations for d, V/I is
actually closer to I/V than IV/V is, and so forth; that is, the chords within
regions should overlap those in an adjacent region. But the representation
nicely illustrates the recursive and hierarchical nature of tonal pitch space.

As it stands, continuing the pattern horizontally in Figure 18 necessitates
skipping parallel regions. This difficulty can be circumvented by adding a
further dimension to Figure 17, forming the "stairs" sketched in Figure 19.
Here VI lies directly below vi, i directly above I, and so on. Regions a fifth or
minor third away remain on one stair. Intraregional chords, in a transformed representation of Figure 18, could then be mapped into Figure 19,
with iii/Tlying directly beneath Ull/i, and so forth, yielding a vertical correspondence between "mixed" versions of the same scale degree and preserving the general pattern of Figure 18. Because each chordal region forms a
torus, different distances would subsist between these vertical chord pairs,
with the pair I-i being the closest. But at this point the geometry becomes
hard to visualize- we are dealing with stairs within a regional torus, within
which there are numerous "satellites" of chordal tori- so I will not attempt
it.

PIVOT CHORDS AND PIVOT REGIONS

Figure 18 suggests a further reason why the above formula for d works
for nearby but not distant regions. Nearby regions share chords that can
function as pivot chords from one region to another. But as chromatic
changes infiltrate more distant regions, direct pivot chords disappear, requiring intermediate pivots that have not yet been taken into account.
Pivots can be thought of as points of tonic reorientation along a stepwise
path. So we return again to the step/skip notion. Regional stepwise motion
might at first be thought of just in terms of vertical or horizontal adjacency
in Figure 17. For example, VI is two steps to the west but three steps to the
north from I. So far this makes sense, since it is indeed a shorter route to VI
via vi than via V and II. However, this conception would make ii as well as
VI and II two steps (rather than one step) away from I, an intuitively undesirable result. This problem could be rectified by including diagonal motion
as stepwise; but then v, too, would be a step from I- even though intuitively
v is accessed from V or i instead.
These and other difficulties can be resolved by calculating steps in regional space via "tonic pivots." Consider Figure 20a, which corresponds to
the regional level of Figure 18. As Figure 20a indicates, the tonic pivots
from I are ii, iii, IV, V, and vi; that is, these are regions whose local tonics
are also chords in I. The diagonal steps to v and iv are excluded, as is the
diminished-chord seventh degree, which is not adjacent even diagonally.
The value of d is given for each region in parentheses. (Note the slight asymmetry due to d(iii) = 9 and d(ii) = 10.) Figure 20b provides in reverse the
tonic pivots from i. Again the values of d are included, this time with d(i)
reset to 0.
Let us call six-regional units such as Figures 20a and 20b pivot regions.
These are analogous to pivot chords, but at a larger level. In terms of Figure
17, these units slide stepwise up and down the fifths axis, but for horizontal
steps they must move in their entirety, linked by parallel regions. Figure 21a
illustrates by shifting the pivot region of Figure 20a northward one notch
and eastward to the entirely nonoverlapping adjacent unit of Figure 20b.
The same moves emerge more perspicuously in Figure 21b, which is based
on the "stair" representation of Figure 19 (parallel regions are on adjacent
stairs).9
If a local tonic is not in the base pivot region, the pivot region can be
moved stepwise until it is, each time adding 7- the step value in all vertical
9. There is a resemblance between these stairs of pivot regions and the blocks (or "compact groups") that Longuet-Higgins uses to move around in his space (Figure 3). His blocks
move up and down the fifths cycle and flip-flop for parallel major-minor relationships.
However, the details and even the levels of analysis are different.

dl(V) + d2(i) = 7 + 7 = 14; or, by the other route, D(v) = dl(i) + d2(\)
= 7 + 7 = 14. Another example: D(III) = dl(iii) + d2(l) = 9 + 7 = 16.
A more complicated example: D(tti) = dfl(iii) + d2(I) + rf3(vi) = 9 + 7 +
7 = 23; or, in more normal terminology, "move from I to iii, then to iii's
parallel major, III, then to Ill's relative minor." But if Hiis understood as t>ii,
then the derivation might be D(tii) = dl(i) + d2{\>\\) + d3{W) +
d4{i) = 7 + 9 + 7 + 7 = 30, which covers a trip from C to c to At to Dt to
dk
The proximity of all regions can be calculated in this manner, using the
values within a pivot region (as shown in Figure 20) in conjunction with the
formula for D. Figure 22a lists the smallest value for D in relation to I for all
the major and minor regions. In Figure 22b these same values are placed in
the context of Figure 17, to indicate the regional stepwise paths.
The values in Figure 22 generally seem adequate- with a few exceptions.
For instance, D(tII) is too large. Perhaps til is just odd: the Neapolitan has
a special history as a replacement for ii° in minor, letting HI insinuate itself
as a pivot chord; and in the nineteenth century, HI appeared extensively in
connection with the enharmonic treatment of the German augmented-sixth

chord (G6 = X^/bll), a chromatic shortcut that lies outside the purview of
the model. On the other hand, a related problem- because bVI lies in bIFs
path- is that D(III) and D(bVI) seem slightly large compared to D(II) or
D(bVII). The difficulty here lies with the idealization toward local tonic
chords as the basis for measurement in regional space. The ease of modulating to HI or bVI arises rather from their tonic chords' sharing of a common
tone with I (unlike II or bVII). A full solution to regional proximity, then,
demands a partial abandonment of this idealization.
Let us continue with the regional space of Figures 17 and 18. There is one
more step to take. Once the region in question falls within the shifted pivot
region, the value of any other, nontonic chord in the region can be calculated in similar fashion. This can be done by moving to the regional tonic
and then summing; and k- that is, by thinking of the nontonic chord solely
in terms of its local tonic. But a smaller overall value can be obtained by
calculating the nontonic chord directly from a regional pivot, provided that
the tonic to which it refers belongs in the pivot region in question. This was
the method used above, for example, for V/ii in Figure 16c. Taken in two
stages, D(V/ii) = dl{ii) + d2(V/i) = 10 + 7 = 17, which is too high a value
{d(I/Vl) = 14); but figured directly, d(V/ii) = 11, which is about right. This
shortcut is possible only because the ii to which this V refers belongs in the
base pivot region. For a more remote case, say to arrive at an fftchord in the
region of c)t, one can count directly from the intermediate E region, since
an f(t chord is a pivot chord within E. Thus D(iv/#i) = dl{in) + d2{\) +

4 (also see Krumhansl & Shepard, 1979). In addition, the values for pc embedding distance in Figure 6 correspond closely to the major key profile in
Krumhansland Kessler (1982), given here in Figure 24. In their experiment,
the "fit" of each pc was rated by listeners who were primed with a tonal
context.
In the minor key profile, however, Krumhansl and Kessler found that
pc3 rated higher than pc7. This result is puzzling, since the hierarchicalrelationship between the third and fifth of a triad is the same in its major and
minor forms. Their result allows them to derive the relative major key as
closely related to the referential minor key, but this seems to be a confusion
of levels. As suggested in this model (through the variable i), the relative
major is so close to the tonic minor because they share the same diatonic
collection.
The notions of embedding and step distance at the pc and pitch level relate to KrumhansPs (1979) finding of asymmetry in judgment in pairs of
tones, whereby an unstable pitch is found to be closer to a stable pitch than
vice versa. In a I/I context, for example, pi 1 ("pitch 11") is psychologically
closer to pl2 than p 12 is to pi 1. In Figure 5 this is reflected in the step and
embedding context of a pitch pair: pll "gravitates" in diatonic space toward the adjacent and weightier pl2, which also belongs to superordinate
levels. In Bharucha's (1984b) terms, pll is unstable and requires subsequent "anchoring" to the proximate and more stable pl2. (This asymmetry
is familiar to musicians in the form of incomplete neighbors or appoggiaturas: the dissonance may be unprepared but must resolve by step to the sue-

space were toward another chord, say V/I, the opposite would be the casepl2 would require anchoring in pi 1. In similar fashion, in a I/I context and
in chromatic space, plO gravitates toward p9 or pi 1 ; in a I/I context and in
triadic space, p4 gravitates toward pO;and so on, throughout various harmonic and regional contexts.
We turn now to chords and regions. The values for d for chords within a
region (Figure 10) correlate well with Krumhansl, Bharucha, and Kessler's
(1982) multidimensional scaling solution, given here in Figure 25, for the
perceptual relatedness of the various diatonic triads to the tonic. Exception
must be made, however, for d(iii), for which the value ; = 4 should evidently be used (see the remarks above regarding iii). With this proviso, it
would appear that listeners intuitively employ the chord circle and common
tones along the lines of the formula d = (i + ) j + k.
The values for chords across regions are supported in a general way by
experiments reported in Krumhansl, Bharucha, and Kessler (1982), with
respect to chords heard in the context of the closely related keys of C major,
G major, and A minor; and by experiments reported in Bharucha and
Krumhansl (1983), with respect to chords heard in the context of the distantly related keys of C major and F(tmajor (also see Krumhansl, Bharucha,
& Castellano, 1982). Furthertesting needs to be done, however, on evaluations of specific chords as heard in different regions.
Moving up to the level of abstract regions, we find that Krumhansl and
Kessler (1982) have established a regional space almost identical to Figure
17. They projected the space in Figure 26 by intercorrelating rating profiles

IV. This results from the translation of a four-dimensional solution to a two-dimensional
format (C. Krumhansl, personal communication, 1987).

It is common for lines to be complete at a level more than one embedding
step above. For instance, the chromatic line p4-p5- p6- p7 is complete at
the triadic level; the diatonic scale is complete at the octave level. Although
most Classical melodies explore completeness at the diatonic and triadic
levels, some acquire their distinctiveness by emphasizing other levels and
combinations of levels. Beethoven's Ninth Symphony begins with an exploration of open-fifth space, eventually filling it in with triadic and diatonic
elaborations. The motivic material of the first movement of the Eroica Symphony often bypasses diatonic space in favor of a combination of triadic
and chromatic spaces (Epstein, 1979). The famous C# in measure 7 motivates a number of dramatic passages in its varied search for completeness.
Completeness occurs not only at the musical surface of a piece but at underlying reductional levels. Incomplete pitches always reduce out, leaving a
residue of completion at a higher level in the space. A Zug eventually collapses into a representation of the harmony embodied in its endpoints.
Other Schenkerianvoice-leading procedures can also be viewed in terms of
completeness at underlying levels. For instance, the Anstieg (initial ascent)
rises diatonically within triadic endpoints; the Bassbrechung, which unites
with the Urlinie to form the all-important Ursatz, projects fifths within octave space.
The notion of completeness accounts as well for important aspects of
Meyer's (1973) theory of melodic implication (see also Narmour, 1977).
Via the Gestalt principle of good continuation, Meyer claims that a diatonic
step implies continuation in the same direction, and likewise for an arpeggiation. (Such an implication can be realized or not.) As with the Zug, this
principle generalizes to all levels of Figure 5. In fact, the basic space offers
one way of constraining the number of implications, an area where
implication-realization theory has been criticized. If, say, a diatonic line
reaches completion at the triadic level, there would be no further implication of continuation in the same direction. Hooked up to a thorough-going
reductional theory, the theory would then be able to invoke a small number
of implications at any point in a given reductional level (Jackendoff & Lerdahl, in preparation).

SECHTER, RIEMANN, AND CHORDAL SPACE

Much ink was spilled by nineteenth-century fundamental-bass theorists
over which root progressions are and are not acceptable (Wason, 1985).
The influential Sechter (1853) restrictedharmonic progressions to root motion by fifths and thirds, excluding motion by seconds, such as I to ii. In
other words, he allowed only vertical or horizontal adjacent motion in the
chordal space of Figure 13, whose "core" is reproduced in Figure 27. If di-

agonal motion in chordal space counts as a skip, he permitted only stepwise
chordal motion.
Progressions such as I- ii happen in real music, of course. For these Sechter was obliged to interpose "intermediate fundamentals," or, conversely,
to relate more than one chord to a single fundamental. Thus, I-ii became I(vi)- ii. These maneuvers led to bizarre harmonic glosses, especially in the
hands of his pupil, the composer Bruckner. Instead of rejecting Sechter's
reasoning entirely, however, I suggest that his real mistake was to have confused the tonal and event hierarchies. Having intuited the chordal space of
Figure 13, he went on to apply it inappropriately to real musical sequences.
There is no reason why chord progressions should not include skips.12
12. Fifty years later, with his more hierarchical and linear approach, Schenkereliminated
unwanted progressions by treating them as voice-leading. This was an advance but not, I

Tonal Pitch Space

Chordal space also bears on Riemann's (1893) functional theory. For
each of his three harmonic pillars, I, IV, and V, he conceived of harmonic
substitutions a root-third away that retain the original function of tonic,
subdominant, or dominant. A substitute a third below (a Parallelklang)
gives tonic function to vi, subdominant function to ii, and dominant function to iii; a substitute a third above (a Leittonwechselklang) gives tonic
function to iii, subdominant function to vi, and dominant function to vii°.
Thus iii and vi can vary in function depending on context.
All of these relationships are implicit in Figure 27. The vertical axis yields
the three harmonic pillars. On the horizontal axis, I is flanked by vi and iii,
IV by ii and vi, and V by iii and vii°.

SCHOENBERG AND REGIONAL SPACE

The regional space of Figure 17 is identical to the Weber/Schoenberg
space. (Krumhansl & Kessler point out the same correspondence with respect to Figure 26.) The method used here of generating the space presumably illuminates why Weber and Schoenberg thought it up in the first place.
They must have conceived of regional distance in terms of regional tonics;
and the equal proximity of I/V, I/TV,i/vi, and i/i is explicated by the formula
ford.
The concept of musical space preoccupied Schoenberg throughout his
career. He invoked it not only in his treatises on tonal harmony (Schoenberg 1911/1978; 1954/1969) but in his central essay on 12-tone composition (Schoenberg 1941/1975). A case can be made that just as he constructed his large-scale 12-tone forms by analogy with tonal forms, so he
built 12-tone space by analogy with tonal pitch space. Each pc has multiple
positions in the space, depending at any particular point on set orientation
instead of on scale and chord orientation. The chordal level emerges largely
from subsets of the row, roughly in the way that triads are subsets of scales
(only "roughly," because there is no analogue to the reductional relationship between triads and scales). The regional level affords the best correspondence: within the framework of hexachordal combinatoriality, two or
more sets create a "12-tone regional unit" that transposes to proximate or
distant regions, where distance is measured by interval cycles of transposition (as with i above) and by invariance of subsets across transposition,
forming "common subsets" instead of common tones (by analogy with k

think, a complete solution. Even voice-leading chords are chords, having a place in the overall event hierarchy and therefore in the tonal hierarchy. (On the other hand, in some cases,
such as parallel six-three progressions, the chords are pure voice-leading.)

344

above). These regional units facilitate a sort of modulation within the 12tone universe.13
For reasons discussed elsewhere (Lerdahl, 1987b), moves within 12-tone
space are not as cognitively transparent as those within tonal space. But the
analogies are interesting, and they help to explain how Schoenbergwas able
to erect such an intellectually rich system.
Incidentally, the so-called Schoenberg-Schenker controversy (see, e.g.,
Dahlhaus, 1973) can be somewhat defused with the realization that
Schenker was primarily interested in event hierarchies and Schoenberg in
the tonal hierarchy. Of course, Schoenberg also had a much more vertical
conception of events than did Schenker; here the difference is real.
PITCH SPACE AND GENERATIVE MUSIC THEORY

There are three subjects I want to touch on briefly with regard to pitch
space and generative music theory.
First, as was pointed out at the beginning, pitch space and stability conditions are in principle the same thing. To the extent that the above model
works, it can therefore replace the verbally stated stability conditions in
GTTM (see especially pp. 224-225). The relevant reductional preference
rules (TSRPR2 and PRPR 3) can then refer to distance measurements in the
space. In the general case and all else being equal, given pitch events x and y
in time-span or prolongational region r, x will dominate y if x is more proximate to the referential center of the space, and conversely if y is more proximate. This formulation works at any reductional level. It is significant here
that pitch space, too, is hierarchical in character. This permits a correspondence between levels of the event and tonal hierarchies that otherwise
would be impossible.
Second, an acknowledged limitation of the GTTM theory is its sketchy
account of voice-leading, an area where Schenker is strong. This is only a
practical limitation, however, requiring not revision but extension of the
theory. The correct solution, I believe, is not to borrow in a literal fashion
Schenker's numerous voice-leading techniques, many of which I take to be
merely colorful descriptions of hierarchical relations, but to adopt their essence through the above generalization of the Zug. That is, the notion of
completeness, as fleshed out through the proposed pitch space, provides the
basis for an account of voice-leading intuitions. (A related shortcoming of
the GTTM theory, its inability to give separate structural descriptions for
different contrapuntal lines, requires a different sort of solution that lies beyond present concerns.)
13. Lewin (1972) discussed such relationships in connection with Schoenberg's Violin
Fantasy, Mead (1985) in connection with Schoenberg's Violin Concerto.

Tonal Pitch Space

Fig. 28. Measures 1-9 of the second movement of Beethoven's Waldstein Sonata, op. 53.

Third, having a theory of the tonal hierarchy permits a richer description
of event hierarchies. Let me illustrate with the opening phrase of the second
movement of Beethoven's Waldstein Sonata, given in Figure 28. Smith
(1986) demonstrates that a linear analysis alone fails to capture the passage's striking harmonic specificity. To rectify this shortcoming, he adds a
leveled Roman-numeral analysis to his linear graph. This step is useful but
does not really convey a sense of the phrase's extraordinary harmonic progression.
A pitch-space description can help. With I/I reset to F major, Figure 29
repeats part of Figure 17b, showing die regional route traveled in the course
of the phrase. A number of diagonal steps leads to a distant, tentative jUVin
measure 4, after which the harmony skips back to vii7V- A6- V7/! in measures 5 and 6. This "map" visualizes the harmonic journey far better than
Roman numerals can.14
But such a map has meaning only in conjunction with a hierarchical analysis. So, following the spirit of Smith's argument, I append a GTTM-style
reduction of the passage in Figure 30.15The time-span reduction (TSR) appears in the upper staves of the musical notation, the prolongational reduction (PR) in the tree and lower staves. Nonessential voices are reduced out
at underlying levels. The octave transfer at underlying levels in measures 1
and 2 is justified by the motivic parallelism with measure 3 and by the re14. Longuet-Higgins (1962/1987), Carpenter (1983), Werts (1983), and others have employed maps such as Figure 29, although not in connection with a reductional analysis.
15. It is beyond my purpose here to discuss the derivation of this analysis or its deviations
from the theory as presented in GTTM. For a rather similar Schenkerian analysis, see Salzer
(1952).
