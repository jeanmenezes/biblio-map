1 Introduction
The only new thing in the world is the
history you don’t know.
Harry S Truman, quoted by David
McCulloch in Truman

The graphic portrayal of quantitative information has deep roots. These roots reach
into histories of thematic cartography, statistical graphics, and data visualization, which
are intertwined with each other. They also connect with the rise of statistical thinking up
through the 19th century, and developments in technology into the 20th century. From
above ground, we can see the current fruit; we must look below to see its pedigree and
germination. There certainly have been many new things in the world of visualization;
but unless you know its history, everything might seem novel.

A brief overview
The earliest seeds arose in geometric diagrams and in the making of maps to aid in navigation and exploration. By the 16th century, techniques and instruments for precise observation and measurement of physical
quantities were well-developed— the beginnings of the husbandry of visualization. The 17th century saw
great new growth in theory and the dawn of practice— the rise of analytic geometry, theories of errors of
measurement, the birth of probability theory, and the beginnings of demographic statistics and “political
arithmetic”. Over the 18th and 19th centuries, numbers pertaining to people—social, moral, medical, and
economic statistics began to be gathered in large and periodic series; moreover, the usefulness of these bodies of data for planning, for governmental response, and as a subject worth of study in its own right, began
to be recognized.
This birth of statistical thinking was also accompanied by a rise in visual thinking: diagrams were used
to illustrate mathematical proofs and functions; nomograms were developed to aid calculations; various
graphic forms were invented to make the properties of empirical numbers– their trends, tendencies, and
distributions— more easily communicated, or accessible to visual inspection. As well, the close relation
of the numbers of the state (the origin of the word “statistics”) and its geography gave rise to the visual
representation of such data on maps, now called “thematic cartography”.
Maps, diagrams and graphs have always been (and continue to be) hard to produce, still harder to publish. Initially they were hand drawn, piece-by-piece. Later they were etched on copper-plate and manually

colored. Still later, lithography and photo-etching, and most recently, computer software was used, but
graphic-makers have always had to struggle with the limitations of available technology— and still do today.
Some note-worthy places in the history of visualization must therefore be reserved for those who contributed
to the technology.
Most recently, advances in statistical computation and graphic display have provided tools for visualization of data unthinkable only a half century ago. Similarly, advances in human-computer interaction have
created completely new paradigms for exploring graphical information in a dynamic way, with ﬂexible user
control.
While most of the recent contributions listed here relate to the visual display of statistical data, there has
also been considerable interplay with advances in information visualization more generally, particularly for
the display of large networks, hierarchies, data bases, text, and so forth, where problems of very-large scale
data present continuing challenges.

Varieties of data visualization
Information visualization is the broadest term that could be taken to subsume all the developments described
here. At this level, almost anything, if sufﬁciently organized, is information of a sort. Tables, graphs, maps
and even text, whether static or dynamic, provide some means to see what lies within, determine the answer
to a question, ﬁnd relations, and perhaps apprehend things which could not be seen so readily in other forms.
In this sense, information visualization takes us back to the earliest scratches of forms on rocks, to the
development of pictoria as mnemonic devices in illuminated manuscripts, and to the earliest use of diagrams
in the history of science and mathematics.
But, as used today, the term information visualization is generally applied to the visual representation of
large-scale collections of non-numerical information, such as ﬁles and lines of code in software systems [61],
library and bibliographic databases, networks of relations on the internet, and so forth. In this document we
avoid both the earliest, and most of the latest uses in this sense.
Another present ﬁeld, called scientiﬁc visualization, is also under-represented here, but for reasons of
lack of expertise rather than interest. This area is primarily concerned with the visualization of 3-D+ phenomena (architectural, meterological, medical, biological, etc.), where the emphasis is on realistic renderings
of volumes, surfaces, illumination sources, and so forth, perhaps with a dynamic (time) component.
Instead, we focus on the slightly narrower domain of data visualization, the science of visual representation of “data”, deﬁned as information which has been abstracted in some schematic form, including
attributes or variables for the units of information. This topic could be taken to subsume the two main focii:
statistical graphics, and thematic cartography.
Both of these are concerned with the visual representation of quantitative and categorical data, but driven
by different representational goals. Cartographic visualization is primarily concerned with representation
constrained to a spatial domain; statistical graphics applies to any domain in which graphical methods are
employed in the service of statistical analysis. There is a lot of overlap, but more importantly, they share
common historical themes of intellectual, scientiﬁc, and technological development.
In addition, cartography and statistical graphics share the common goals of visual representation for
exploration and discovery. These range from the simple mapping of locations (land mass, rivers, terrain),
to spatial distributions of geographic characteristics (species, disease, ecosystems), to the wide variety of
graphic methods used to portray patterns, trends, and indications.

Milestones Project
The past only exists insofar as it is
present in the records of today. And
what those records are is determined
by what questions we ask.

There are many historical accounts of developments within the ﬁelds of probability [106], statistics
[200, 212, 243], astronomy [221], cartography [282], which relate to, inter alia, some of the important developments contributing to modern data visualization. There are other, more specialized accounts, which
focus on the early history of graphic recording [123, 124], statistical graphs [84, 85, 229, 254], ﬁtting equations to empirical data [64], cartography [81, 146] and thematic mapping [225, 198], and so forth; Robinson
[225, Ch. 2] presents an excellent overview of some of the important scientiﬁc, intellectual, and technical
developments of the 15th–18th centuries leading to thematic cartography and statistical thinking.
But there are no accounts that span the entire development of visual thinking and the visual representation of data, and which collate the contributions of disparate disciplines. In as much as their histories are
intertwined, so too should be any telling of the development of data visualization. Another reason for interweaving these accounts is that practitioners in these ﬁelds today tend to be highly specialized, and unaware
of related developments in areas outside their domain, much less their history. Extending Wheeler [286], the
records of history also exist insofar as they are collected, illustrated, and made coherent.
This listing is but an initial step in portraying the history of the visualization of data. We started with
the developments listed by Beniger and Robyn [19] and incorporated additional listings from Hankins [110],
Tufte [258, 259, 260], Heiser [118], and others (now too numerous to cite individually). In most cases, we
cite original sources (where known) for the record; occasional secondary sources are included as well, where
they appear to contribute to telling the story.
To convey a real sense of the accomplishments requires much more context— words, images, and, most
usefully, interpretation. In this chronological listing, it has proved convenient to make divisions by epochs,
and we provide some more detailed commentaries for each of these. The careful reader will be able to
discern other themes, relations, and connections, not stated explicitly.
More importantly, we envisage this Milestones Project as the beginning of a contribution to historiography, on the subject of visualization. One goal is to provide a ﬂexible, and useful multi-media resource,
containing descriptions of events and developments, illustrative images, and links to related sources (web
and in print) or more detailed commentaries. Another goal is to build a database which collects, catalogs,
organizes, and illustrates these signiﬁcant historical developments.
The present listing is simply chronological, but, as noted above, we provide some overview for each
epoch. We have also begun coding the listings to be dynamically searchable by other criteria, for example
by person, place, theme, content, and so forth. A parallel web version may be viewed on the Gallery of Data

2 Pre-17th Century: Early maps and diagrams
The earliest seeds of visualization arose in geometric diagrams, in tables of the
positions of stars and other celestial bodies, and in the making of maps to aid in navigation and exploration. We list only a few of these here to provide some early context
against which later developments can be viewed.
In the 16th century, techniques and instruments for precise observation and measurement of physical quantities were well-developed. As well, we see initial ideas for
capturing images directly, and recording mathematical functions in tables. These early
steps comprise the beginnings of the husbandry of visualization.

3 1600-1699: Measurement and theory
Among the most important problems of the 17th century were those concerned
with physical measurement— of time, distance, and space— for astronomy, surveying,
map making, navigation and territorial expansion. This century saw great new growth
in theory and the dawn of practice— the rise of analytic geometry, theories of errors
of measurement and estimation, the birth of probability theory, and the beginnings of
demographic statistics and “political arithmetic”.
By the end of this century, the necessary elements were at hand— some real data
of signiﬁcant interest, some theory to make sense of them, and a few ideas for their
visual representation. Perhaps more importantly, one can see this century as giving
rise to the beginnings of visual thinking.

4 1700-1799: New graphic forms
The 18th century witnessed, and participated in, the initial germination of the seeds
of visualization which had been planted earlier. Map-makers began to try to show more
than just geographical position on a map. As a results, new graphic forms (isolines
and contours) were invented, and thematic mapping of physical quantities took root.
Towards the end of this century, we see the ﬁrst attempts at the thematic mapping of
geologic, economic, and medical data.
Abstract graphs, and graphs of functions were introduced, along with the early beginnings of statistical theory (measurement error) and systematic collection of empirical
data. As other (economic and political) data began to be collected, some novel visual
forms were invented to portray them, so the data could “speak to the eyes”.
As well, several technological innovations provided necessary nutrients. These facilitated the reproduction of data images (color printing, lithography), and other developments eased the task of creating them. Yet, most of these new graphic forms appeared
in publications with limited circulation, unlikely to attract wide attention.

In statistical graphics, all of the modern forms of data display were invented: bar and
pie charts, histograms, line graphs and time-series plots, contour plots, and so forth.
In thematic cartography, mapping progressed from single maps to comprehensive atlases, depicting data on a wide variety of topics (economic, social, moral, medical,
physical, etc.), and introduced a wide range of novel forms of symbolism.

6 1850–1899: Golden Age of data graphics
By the mid-1800s, all the conditions for the rapid growth of visualization had been
established. Ofﬁcial state statistical ofﬁces were established thoughout Europe, in
recognition of the growing importance of numerical information for social planning, industrialization, commerce, and transportation. Statistical theory, initiated by Gauss and
Laplace, and extended to the social realm by Quetelet, provided the means to make
sense of large bodies of data.
What started as the “Age of Enthusiasm” [198] in graphics and thematic cartography, may also be called the “Golden Age”, with unparalleled beauty and many innovations.

7 1900–1949: Modern Dark Ages
If the early 1800s were the “golden age” of statistical graphics and thematic cartography, the early 1900s could be called the “modern dark ages” of visualization [79].
There were few graphical innovations, and, by the mid-1930s, the enthusiasm for
visualization which characterized the late 1800s had been supplanted by the rise of
quantiﬁcation and formal, often statistical, models in the social sciences. Numbers,
parameter estimates, and, especially, standard errors were precise. Pictures were—
well, just pictures: pretty or evocative, perhaps, but incapable of stating a “fact” to three
or more decimals. Or so it seemed to statisticians.
But it is equally fair to view this as a time of necessary dormancy, application, and
popularization, rather than one of innovation. In this period statistical graphics became
“main stream.” Graphical methods entered textbooks [202, 100, 114, 197, 141], the
curriculum [43, 283], and standard use in government [8], commerce [94, 235] and
science.
In this period graphical methods were used, perhaps for the ﬁrst time, to provide
new insights, discoveries, and theories in astronomy, physics, biology, and other sciences. As well, experimental comparisons of the efﬁcacy of various graphics forms
were begun, e.g., [59], and a number of practical aids to graphing were developed.
In the latter part of this period, new ideas and methods for multi-dimensional data in
statistics and psychology would provide the impetus to look beyond the 2D plane.

of the machinery of modern statistical methodology, and the advent of the computational power which would support the next wave of developments in data visualization.

8 1950–1974: Re-birth of data visualization
Still under the inﬂuence of the formal and numerical zeitgeist from the mid-1930s
on, data visualization began to rise from dormancy in the mid 1960s, spurred largely
by three signiﬁcant developments:
• In the USA, John W. Tukey, in a landmark paper, “The Future of Data Analysis”
[261], issued a call for the recognition of data analysis as a legitimate branch of
statistics distinct from mathematical statistics; shortly, he began the invention of
a wide variety of new, simple, and effective graphic displays, under the rubric of
“Exploratory Data Analysis” (EDA). Tukey’s stature as a statistician and the scope
of his informal, robust, and graphical approach to data analysis were as inﬂuential
as his graphical innovations. Although not published until 1977, chapters from
Tukey’s EDA book [264] were widely circulated as they began to appear in 1970–
1972, and began to make graphical data analysis both interesting and respectable
again.

• In France, Jacques Bertin published the monumental Semiologie Graphique [24].
To some, this appeared to do for graphics what Mendeleev had done for the organization of the chemical elements, that is, to organize the visual and perceptual
elements of graphics according to the features and relations in data.
• But the skills of hand-drawn maps and graphics had withered during the dormant
“modern dark ages” of graphics (though every ﬁgure in Tukey’s EDA [264] was, by
intention, hand-drawn). Computer processing of data had begun, and offered the
possibility to construct old and new graphic forms by computer programs. True
high-resolution graphics were developed, but would take a while to enter common
use.
By the end of this period signiﬁcant intersections and collaborations would begin:
(a) computer science research (software tools, C language, UNIX, etc.) at Bell Laboratories [14] and elsewhere would combine forces with (b) developments in data analysis
(EDA, psychometrics, etc.) and (c) display and input technology (pen plotters, graphic
terminals, digitizer tablets, the mouse, etc.). These developments would provide new
paradigms, languages and software packages for expressing and implementing statistical and data graphics. In turn, they would lead to an explosive growth in new visualization methods and techniques.
Other themes begin to emerge, mostly as initial suggestions: (a) various visual representations of multivariate data; (b) animations of a statistical process; (c) perceptuallybased theory (or just informed ideas) related to how graphic attributes and relations
might be rendered to better convey the data to the eyes.

9 1975–present: High-D data visualization
It is harder to provide a succinct overview of the most recent developments in data
visualization, because they are so varied, have occurred at an accelerated pace, and
across a wider range of disciplines. It is also more difﬁcult to highlight the most signiﬁcant developments (and because we have focused on the earlier history), so there are
presently areas and events unrepresented here.
With this disclaimer, a few major themes stand out:
• the development of a variety of highly interactive computer systems and more
importantly,
• new paradigms of direct manipulation for visual data analysis (linking, brushing,
selection, focusing, etc.)
• new methods for visualizing high-dimensional data (grand tour, scatterplot matrix,
parallel coordinates plot, etc.);
• the invention of new graphical techniques for discrete and categorical data (fourfold display, sieve diagram, mosaic plot, etc.), and analogous extensions of older
ones (diagnostic plots for generalized linear models, mosaic matrices, etc.) and,
• the application of visualization methods to an ever-expanding array of substantive
problems and data structures.
These developments in visualization methods and techniques arguably depended
on advances in theoretical and technological infrastructure. Some of these are: (a)
large-scale software engineering; (b) extensions of classical linear statistical modeling to wider domains; (c) vastly increased computer processing speed and capacity,
allowing computationally intensive methods and access to massive data problems.
In turn, the combination of these themes and advances now provides some solutions for earlier problems.
