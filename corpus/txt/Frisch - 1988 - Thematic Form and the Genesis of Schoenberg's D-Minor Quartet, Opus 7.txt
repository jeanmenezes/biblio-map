specifically to Wagner's TristanPrelude, which he sees
as a significant precedessor of the "formal problems" in Schoenberg's early works.
3 Similar assessments of the work's integrated thematicism are given by Webern
and Berg, excerpted in Rauchhaupt 1971, i6 and 20-30.

4Schoenberg's principal analyses are those that appearedin Die Musikin 1907 and
in his "Notes on the Four String Quartets"of I949; both are reprinted in Rauchhaupt
1971, i i-3 and 36-42. (Rauchhaupt gives incorrect dates for these analyses.) My
schematic analysis in Table i is based closely upon Schoenberg's own, with one
important modification: I hear the return of the main theme in C# minor at letter C
as a first recapitulation, not as a continuing part of the first development. Although
the thematic material is highly varied here, it does in fact return in its original order.
I am indebted to Severine Neff (Neff 1984) for suggesting this way of hearing the
section from C through D. As Schmidt points out in his article on Schoenberg's
commentaries (Schmidt 1984), the composer is not always precise about where the
sonata-form sections begin and end; there is even some discrepancy between the
analyses of 1907 and I949.

Throughout the present article I refer to places in the score by means of a
rehearsal letter and, when necessary, a subsidiary measure number (which begin
again at i with each letter), as in the original score (Berlin, 1907) and the widely
available reprint by Kalmus. In the new edition of the quartet (Schoenberg 1986, A),
continuous measure numbers are used; these are given in parentheses in Table i.
5Liquidation, in Schoenberg's vocabulary, involves "graduallyeliminating characteristic features [of a theme], until only uncharacteristic ones remain, which no
longer demand a continuation" (Schoenberg i967, 58).

No synoptic formal diagram can do justice to the richness of Opus
7, especially to the interpenetrationof the thematic material and to the
continuous process that seems to generate the larger structure before
our very ears. We can trace this process briefly across the 3oo-measure
segment comprising the transition, second group, first development
and recapitulation, and scherzo. The transition is one of the least
tonally-oriented passages in the entire quartet. It is almost pure
counterpoint, a fugato based on a highly chromatic theme, which is

projects, principally the songs that were to become Opus 8.8 Some
fourteen pages later he returned to Opus 7, but did not, as we might
expect, pick up where he left off, in the first group. He began instead
to sketch the scherzo theme, well in advance of its eventual appearance. The theme appearsin short score in the key of Bb(as transcribed
in Example 4; cf. S 2, p. 67).9 Despite its tonality and certain striking
differences of harmony and voice leading, the theme is quite close to
its final form (cf. Example 3 above). After six measures the sketch
trails off to only the top part, and ends altogether after sixteen
measures. The rest of the page is occupied by brief sketches of
possible developments or continuations of the scherzo.
8 This would have been in
mid-July 1904. In a letter to Oskar Posa written on 13
July, Schoenberg notes that he has begun a new orchestral song and has set aside the
quartet for the time being: "Mein Quartett ruht. Vielleicht komme ich aber doch noch
dazu." (Cited in Szmolyan 1974, 193.)
9 Above the first scherzo sketch
appears the phrase "Neues leben fuhlend." This
relates to Schoenberg's private program for Opus 7, which is contained on a
handwritten sheet affixed to che back cover of Sketchbook I. The program-really a
description of successive emotional states (what Schumann would have called
Seelenzustdnde)-isreproduced in Schoenberg I986, B: o09-Io, and also in Schmidt
I986. Its possible role in the genesis of Opus 7 has been discussed by Mark Benson

(Benson 1987).

But Schoenberg attempted no larger draft of the scherzo at this

another step backward to his previous stopping point. The first

In its initial form, Example 5a, the theme makes no apparentreference
to motives b and c; the principal melody and the bass part lack the
syncopation characteristicof these motives. Schoenberg thus seems to
work more from a harmonic skeleton than from a fully thematic
conception. Directly beneath this sketch, however, Schoenberg in

Since he gave the cover of Sketchbook I the number Ski, Rufer's numbers are off by
one from Schoenberg's own page numbers, which appear on the odd pages. (Rufer
also numbered the pages continuously through Sketchbooks I and II.) In Table 2 and
throughout this article I follow Schoenberg's numbering.

2-3 of page 32 (SI6, p. 52; see my Figure i) is a "Vorentwurf"for the second group.

I am not persuaded, since this sketch bears no resemblance to the final form of the
theme and no significant trace of motives b or c. (It might be entirely unrelated to
Opus 7.) Schmidt's conjecture, however, would support my broader thesis that the
idea of thematicizing the second group-and making it relate to the scherzo and
transition-did not occur to Schoenberg immediately.
Schmidt has also proposed that the sketch on staves 6-7 (S2o, p. 71) is related to
the trio of the scherzo. This seems even less likely, since the trio is (like most pieces
of the genre) in triple meter and is a transformation of the scherzo. The sketch is
clearly in 4/4 and manifests no obvious derivation from the scherzo; it is probably
unrelated to Opus 7.
12 We find a similar
phenomenon in the sketches for the First Chamber Symphony, Opus 9, in Sketchbook II. In the midst of sketches for the development section,
Schoenberg wrote out the first two measures of the secondary theme of the exposition
(mm. 84-85). Schmidt suggests plausibly that this jotting represents an aide-memoire
since the head motive of this theme plays an important role in this
(Gedichtnisstutze),
particular passage of the development. See Schmidt's transcription and commentary
in Schoenberg I979, B: 65.

score, is a first, six-measure mini-draft of the transition itself (Example
8; cf. S25, p. 46), in which the imitative texture and all the thematic
material are present, including a new motive, c, which Schoenberg
has derived from the syncopations in the second theme on the
previous page (Example 5b). Schoenberg has himself now labeled the
motives a, b, and c. Motive b still has a prominent whole step (GI-A!,
in m. 2); its ascent does not yet consist only of half steps.
On the remainder of this page we see the "cerebral"Schoenberg
trying out various three-partcombinations of the motives in four more
short sketches.14 The first, at the left, contains a, b, and c. In the
middle one the two upper voices present b in imitation over c; at the
far right motive a is in the two upper voices, c in the bottom. The last
sketch, at the very bottom right of the page, contains all three
motives, like the one at the far left. Preceding it, in short score, is a
sketch for the passage leading up to the transition and comprising the
liquidation of material from the first group. Schoenberg was now
beginning to place this transition material into its eventual context.
At some point during, or soon after, his work on this page-that
after isolating motive b-I believe that Schoenberg turned back to

sketching activity for the transition-in which Schoenberg tries out various combinations of the motives labeled a, b, and c-is found on two loose leaves and in a pocket
sketchbook, which must have been used concurrently with Sketchbook I. These
sketches are transcribed ibid., pp. 44-51. In one sketch (SI34, P. 44) Schoenberg
wrote out the scherzo theme in its original form, apparently again as an aide-memoire.

page 1/32 and added the syncopated measure in the margin for the
bass part of the second theme (see Example 5b and Figure 1above). He
thus tightened still further the net of thematic associations between
this theme, the transition, and the scherzo. And he confirmed the final
form of motive b, with its ascending semitones (here C#-D-E,, in the
viola).
In his critical and theoretical writings Schoenberg often stresses
that a motivic or thematic idea must have generative power-that all
the events of a piece must be implicit in, or foreseen in, the basic
shape or Grundgestalt
presented at the opening.15 In some of the
exercises in his textbook Fundamentals MusicalComposition shows
he
of
student composers how to elaborate an initial motive into an entire
small work (Schoenberg 1967, 63-67). The transition, second group,
development, and scherzo of the D-minor Quartet can be heard as an
extremely sophisticated example of this process on a massive scale.
But the series of sketch pages we have just examined (1/31-33)
suggests that the hearing and the making were hardly as congruent as
Schoenberg's textbook (or his own statements on the creative process)
might suggest. The "basic shape" from which Schoenberg forged this
particularcomplex of thematic material was the scherzo theme. 16The
compositional process appears to have involved a gradual
chromaticization of a diatonic scherzo theme into the transition
theme-a process that is then reversed in the actual quartet, where the
scherzo is made to serve as the culmination, rather than the germination.

IV
With these three pages of concept sketches Schoenberg resolved
many of the problems of creating a thematically integrated and
continuous form. He now returned to the first group and, on pages
15

See, for example, his remarksin the essay "LinearCounterpoint" (Schoenberg
1975, 290), where he postulates: "'Whatever happens in a piece of music is nothing
but the endless reshaping of a basic shape.' Or, in other words, there is nothing in a
piece of music but what comes from the theme, springs from it and can be traced back
to it; to put it still more severely, nothing but the theme itself. Or, all the shapes
appearing in a piece of music areforeseenin the 'theme'."
16 I do not deal here with the
opening, main theme of the quartet, which in
for
Schoenberg's sense would, of course, contain the ultimate Grundgestalt the work,
as is suggested by Severine Neff (I984, I3). Although I am sure that aspects of the
scherzo theme could be derived from the main theme by skillful analysis, I am
concerned here more with obvious transformations than with what Schoenberg
would call "remote developments."

304

JOURNALOF THE AMERICAN

1/34--II/6, wrote out an extensive and more or less continuous draft
of the entire first half of the quartet, through the trio. The matter of
thematic and formal logic arose again, however, as Schoenberg
planned the second half of the quartet. As Table 2 suggests, the
steady flow of composition came to a halt on II/i6, at the beginning of
the passage that was to serve as both scherzo recapitulationand second
development. Schoenberg had here to reconcile two demands: that of
the larger sonata-form design, which necessitated the further development of earlier material, and that of the individual movement,
which required a symmetrical restatement of the scherzo theme.
He also began to think about the shape that the latter part of the
quartet would take-or at least set down the first evidence of that
thinking. Here, too, there were potentially conflicting demands. A
slow movement and finale had to have sufficient independence as
movements, yet to fulfill their role in the larger sonata-form design
they had also to recapitulate earlier material. Schoenberg's ultimate
answer was to fashion the main theme of the slow movement of Opus
7 (Example 9a) as essentially new material. Unlike the scherzo it does
not grow out of or emerge from any obvious thematic process. Indeed,
the slow movement comes as a distinct contrast or relaxation after the
recapitulation and intense liquidation of the first theme. The main
theme of the finale is virtually a Lisztian transformation of the slow
movement, whose first six measures are taken over note for note
(Example 9b). The episodes of the finale serve to recall, if not exactly
recapitulate, all previous material.
This ingenious formal and thematic design was anything but
obvious to Schoenberg when he was at II/i8 of the sketches, when he
broke off a tentative attempt at the scherzo recapitulation to draft a
slow movement (given as Example IO; cf. S75, pp. 78-80). This
fragment, in the key of Bb minor, extends 39 measures in full score. It
has no tempo marking and no label, but I take it (as does Schmidt) to
be a first attempt at a slow movement. Unlike the eventual slow
movement theme, it is based entirely on material from the second
group of the exposition. It begins with eight measures of syncopated
chordal accompaniment in which the cello plays the highest part.
(This accompaniment pattern, with a characteristic appoggiatura
figure, derives from the development section of movement i; see B
14.) In m. 9 the first violin enters with a melody derived quite clearly
from the oscillating syncopated half steps of motive c, as heard in the
principal theme of the second group (see Example 2). At m. 23 there
is a cadence to Bb minor. Underneath the sustained DL of the first
violin, the lower parts now play the other main theme of the second

group, in its original 6/4 meter. As the first violin resumes its melodic
status, the lower parts continue in 6/4, with a sighing pulsating figure.
After another cadence to B6 minor in m. 33, and two bars of
transition, the second violin begins the original theme, accompanied
by a new decorative figure in the first violin.
Here the sketch trails off, perhaps because Schoenberg was not
satisfied with what he had produced, or perhaps because he had
sketched enough to satisfy himself how the movement would go. At
any rate, these 39 measures suggest that, like the scherzo recapitulation sketched on the previous pages, the passage was to serve a dual
function, as both slow movement and recapitulation of the second
group.
Schoenberg's mind turned now to thoughts for the last movement.
Directly beneath this slow movement fragment, we find the first
sketches for the finale theme. There are three, one above the other
(Examples i Ia, b, c; cf. S77-79, pp. 87-88). The first, in A major, has
lithe, energetic eighth notes. The second, still in A, slows down the
motion and eliminates the melodic diminution. The theme now has
also the beginnings of an accompaniment. The third sketch transposes
the second to D major, the tonic of the work as a whole.
In Examples i ib and c the theme is quite close to its final form (cf.
Example 9b), except for the contour of the opening three-note figure,
which here is a transformationof motive b, a descending leap followed

by a chromatic ascent. As in the preceding draft of the slow
movement (Example io), then, Schoenberg was deriving his thematic
material exclusively (and audibly) from the first movement of the
quartet. But this logical chain of thematic associations did not satisfy
him. Indeed, he may have felt that he had linked that chain too
tightly, that his quartet lacked enough genuine contrast.
He broke off these concept sketches for the finale, and on the next
page, II/2I, began a draft in full score of the slow movement as we
now know it. Its theme (cf. Example 9a) is clearly related to the finale
theme just sketched, but any direct association with motive b has been
eliminated. The opening three-note figure now repeats the first note
and leaps down a fifth. It is thus essentially new thematic material.
When Schoenberg came to write out the draft for the finale, beginning
on II/42 (see Table 2), he began to write the theme out as in Example
i IC(cf. S94, pp. 89-9o), but then crossed out that version and rewrote
the theme to bring it into conformity with the slow movement. As
already demonstrated in Example 9, the finale became an almost
literal transformation of the slow movement.
Establishing this relationship between the two movements was, I
believe, the last major conceptual problem Schoenberg encountered in
planning the D-minor quartet.17 He had found a way to give the
second half of the quartet (the portion after the fermata) its own
thematic integrity or identity without abandoning its purely
17The
autograph score of the quartet, however, is far from a clean copy. It
contains numerous revisions, most notably large cuts in the first development and
recapitulation. (See Schoenberg 1986, B: IoI-9.)

What Adorno and others have claimedfor Opus 7 was in fact a
concern of Schoenberg'sfrom the outset. The sketches and drafts
show in strikingfashionthat the largerformwas to be heardto grow
logically, inexorably, out of a continuous thematic process. To
accomplishthis task on such a massive scale challengedeven the
normally "spontaneous"

similarproblemsin planninghis C#-minor Quartet-a workthat, as
Schoenberghimself acknowledged,is one of the most important
precursorsof his own (see the liner notes cited in Steiner 1978,

portionsof the sketch materialfor the Beethovenquartetconsist of
"telescopeddrafts," pages in which Beethoven momentarilysteps
