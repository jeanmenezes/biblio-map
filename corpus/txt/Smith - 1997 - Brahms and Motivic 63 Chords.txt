BRAHMSAND MOTIVIC 6/3 CHORDS

Introduction
Brahms has long been admired for his powers of motivic integration, his
'progressive' harmony and his proclivity for blurred formal articulations.* A
quintessentiallyBrahmsian amalgamation of the motivic, harmonic and formal
dimensions is the composer's use of motivic 6/3 chords at points of formal
articulation. The topic divides into two categories: 6/3 chords that arise via a
5-6 motion over a tonic bass and 6/3 chords that function as inversions of the
tonic. The opening of the scherzo from the Piano Quintet provides an example
of a type 1 6/3 chord (Ex. 1). A striking instance of a type 2 chord is the initial
tonic ofthe BSminor Intermezzo (Ex. 2). Both types of 6/3 chord are powerful
means through which Brahms destabilises or delays tonic articulation - a
hallmarkof his engagement with traditionalforms.l A 6/3 chord at the opening
boundary of a tonic prolongation invests generic harmonic function with
idiosyncratic character. The individuality of the context extends beyond
features that make any tonic articulation unique - thematic material, voicing,
instrumentation, registration, etc. - to include either an atypical pitch content
or an unconventional bass pitch.
The two types of 6/3 chord accentuate the importance of context for
harmonic analysis. At a level of abstraction that is often useful for chord
classification, the opening harmonies of the scherzo and the Intermezzo fall
into the same category as first inversion triads. From this perspective, the main
difference between the chords is their quality. Yet despite similarities of
interval content, the two harmonies relate to their tonal environments in very
different ways. The 'first inversion' classification might suggest Romannumeral functions of VI6 and I6, respectively. The scherzo, however, like the

Intermezzo, articulates tonic function. Ex. 3 illustrates the contrasting linear
and harmonic derivation for the two harmonies. In the scherzo, Alw
displaces
the G fifth of the 5/3 chord that is implied above C in bars 1-2. Because we
infer tonic function from the bass, what we are dealing with is fundamentallya
root position chord. Though the opening material contains the pitches of the
submediant, it does not articulate submediant function. (In this sense, type 1
motives are like cadential 6/4 chords, which contain the pitches of the tonic
but which function as part of the dominant.) In the Intermezzo, on the other
hand, the sixth above the bass itself represents the tonic; we can speak of
type 2 motives as first inversion harmonies in terms of both abstract chord
structure and concrete tonal function. A major contribution of Schenkerian
theory has been its insight into these types of functional distinctions.2

One of Brahms's sources for development of his motivic 6/3 chords relates
to the influence of context on harmonic function. The duality of submediant
pitch content and tonic function makes type 1 chords especially rich in
possibilities for harmonic reinterpretation.Indeed, type 1 motives often return
independent of their original position within tonic expansion. The attention
that Brahms focuses on alternativetonal implications will lead us to reconsider
the idea that the submediant pitch content of type 1 chords is harmonically
insignificant.Another point that will emerge is that type 1 and 2 harmonies are
not the polar opposites that my analysis of the scherzo and Intermezzo implies.

Ex. 4 illustrates reversals of standard type 1 and type 2 function. The
Schenkerian approach that I have just outlined would seem to deny the
possibility for these interpretations. Yet we will see that Brahms draws
consequences from the apparent submediant embedded within his type 1
motives; linear 6/3 chords can take on significance as inversions. Similarly,the
sixth of a type 2 chord can function as a displacement of the fifth of III, rather
than as a representative of the tonic root; reinterpreted in this way, an
inversional 6/3 chord inflects a harmonic frameworkthat is oriented around a
stationary bass. One of my goals will be to take advantage of Schenkerian
insights, without denying the possibility for a type 1 chord to function as an
inversion or for a type 2 chord to function as part of a 5-6 motion.

Because type 1 motives appear more frequently in Brahms, it will be helpful
to put the second category aside and focus on the first group. I will return to
first inversion tonics toward the end of this study, after a thorough exploration
of Brahms's type 1 usage. Table 1 summarises some of the transformations
that Brahms applies to type 1 chords. The fascination of the motivic process is
not in the transformations per se, but in the interaction of the motivic
dimension with formal and tonal context. From the perspective of motivic
association, the changes are minimal, especially if a given transformation is
counterbalancedby invariance in other dimensions. A chromatic adjustment,
an addition of a pitch or a change in bass, however, can have enormous
consequences for chord function. The Quintet scherzo provides a straightforward example. Consider the repetition of the thematic idea at bar 43
(Ex. 5). The addition of FXin no way weakens the obvious connection with the
opening theme. Yet this XIV7/;3
transformation is sufficient to allow the 6/3
chordto operate in a drasticallydifferent context. Material that was originally
partof a tonic point of departure is absorbed into a retransitional dominant
prolongation.It is important to observe that the fragment retains C as bass
regardlessof the new tonal environment - a factor that both confirms the
motivic character of the 6/3 position and expands the possible harmonic
functionsfor the C pedal.3
One way to approach these two motive forms is as different consequences of
the same musical idea. The C pedal throughout the opening phrase and the
i-4-8 bass at bar 13's imperfect cadence support an initial tonic attribution,

as does the preparatory dominant and G-C bass at the counterstatement of
the material at bar 47. The reorientation of the motive around the dominant in
the retransitionis, if anything, even more single-minded. I prefer, however, to
treat flexibility of harmonic function as an invitation for retrospective
reevaluation.The situation requires sensitivity not only to changing functions
of a motive in new contexts, but also to reinterpretationsof an original based
on different listening perspectives.4 This analytical approach treats motivic
processas a form of self-analysis. What a composer reveals about his material
in a restatement sheds light on the original. The instability of the #IV7/;3
transformation,for example, highlights the tenuous character of the head
motive.Despite the aforementioned indications of tonic function, the idea has
built into it the instability that comes to the fore in the retransition. The
arpeggiotheme articulates Abas a frame around C and ES,rather than as the
displacementof G that we might expect in a more explicit 5-6 motion. The
disorientation that arises from bass emphasis on the tonic and melodic

emphasis on the submediant is heightened by the syncopation of the parts.
Even at the counterstatement at bar 47, the premature intrusion of ASdisrupts
a moment of potential harmonic clarity; elision of the 5/3 harmony pushes
tonic function, which was already a matter of implication in the original, even
further into the conceptual realm.
The elision at bar 47 also accentuates the most basic difference between the
counterstatement and the original: the repetition repositions a point of
initiation within a larger continuity. On the one hand, the preparatory
dominant and G-C bass support a tonic attribution, as mentioned above. Yet
the counterstatement - like the retransition - also further exposes the degree
to which the original contains the seeds for dominant reinterpretation. One
crucial moment for analysis of the 6/3 chord is the FkAS neighbour around G
in bars 49-50. The addition of F# reawakens the #IV7/;3transformation and
points the motivic sonority ahead again toward the dominant. Ex. 5 illustrates
this connection across the entrance of the counterstatement. The framing of
the thematic return within two #IV7/;3-Vprogressions joins the premature
entrance of ASat bar 47 to pull the head motive from its tonic moorings. The
result is a characteristicallyBrahmsian ambivalence: a formal articulation that
both evokes and effaces the tonic. The opening material itself can be heard as
a less extreme form of the same strategy:the original is a 'scattered' version of
the #IV7/;3
transformation. In this view, the accumulation of pitches - first the
AS arpeggiation, then the FkAS neighbour, and finally the C-BWmelodic
motions in bars 6 and 8 - gradually draw the opening phrase into the orbit of
the dominant. The initial type 1 chord does not articulate a solid point of
departure, but rather forms part of an anacrusis to the imperfect cadence at
bar 13.
The statement and counterstatement of the main theme illustrate the
tendency for motivic 6/3 chords to destabilise tonic articulation. (Later we will
have occasion to observe 6/3 chords that participate in outright tonal delay.)
The passages also help to establish some basic characteristicsof the analytical
method for this study. Brahms's motivic 6/3 chords are profitably approached
with diverse analytical tools. My analyses will continue to combine a
Schenkerian approach to tonal structure, a transformationalmodel of motivic
process, and traditional formal concepts. Throughout, I will focus on multiple
interpretations of events based on different listening perspectives. A central
concern will be to evaluate the effect, on the characterof the opening tonic, of
both the initial 6/3 chords and the motivic processes they generate. I will also
address relationships between motivic 6/3 chords and key areas, and the role
these chords often play in creating unity across Brahms's multi-movement
cycles. The Quintet, in fact, develops issues of cyclic unity in tandem with
links between 6/3 chords and key areas. It will be fruitful therefore to continue
with it. I will then move on to consider excerpts from the following works: the

the C minor String Quartet, Op. 51 No. 1; the E; major Horn Trio, Op. 40;
the Tragic Overture, Op. 81; the F major Viola Quintet, Op. 88; and the B;
minor Intermezzo, Op. 117 No. 2. Because the motivic 6/3 chords in these
pieces often interact with large-scale tonal structure, the reader will find it
necessaryto have complete scores handy for each.

The F minor Piano Quintet, Op. 34
Up to this point, I have focused on the potential for a type 1 motive to shift
emphasis off the tonic and onto the dominant. This compositional strategy
takes advantage of multiple possibilities of tonal function for 8. The pitch
easilyfunctions within tonic prolongation, not only as part of a 5-6 motion but
also as part of other common techniques of tonic expansion such as I-IV-I
progressions. But in minor, the descending leading-note potential of 8 is one
of the most powerful means to intensify motion to or around V. The anacrusic
character of the main theme, in relation to the dominant, encourages
consideration of another context with an important influence on harmonic
interpretation: the preparation of a movement by the conclusion of the
previous movement. Indeed, motivic 6/3 chords often participate in this type
a
of inter-movement continuity. Though Brahms does not mark attacca,
A; tonic of
performance that pauses briefly can create a link between the final
the slow movement and the scherzo's motivic 6/3 chord. Ex. 6 shows that,
even at the outset, the tonic is undercut by a retrospective connection across
the C articulation, similar to the continuity at the counterstatement. Here we
see the first suggestion of submediant function for a type 1 motive. The order
of pitches in the upper parts takes on special significance when heard in
relation to the previous A; tonic. This listening perspective further complicates
the inference of a 5/3 chord above C by making the bass sound like a chordal
third. The status of the 6/3 chord as an inversion of A; meshes with the
material'ssubsequent independence from tonic function.5
The continuity at the crossoverinto the scherzo is part of a network of intermovement connections. The scherzo's 6/3 chord bears special relationship
with a primary source of pan-movement integration: the pitch DS, which
functions both as a melodic neighbour and as a key area throughout the cycle.
Ex. 7a shows the initial statement of the D; motive in the main theme of the
first movement. Ex. 7b interprets the material in relation to a structural tonic.
Here, in contrast to the scherzo, it is the 5-6 motion that is more explicit; the
listener must infer a tonic bass. The similarity of the passages is obvious
nevertheless. The relationship extends to the potential for multiple interpretations that undercut a tonic attribution. Ex. 8 outlines one alternative.The
graph highlights the prominence of C in the lowest voice of the theme's

polyphonic melody. The absence of harmonisation allows the C to connect to
the goal dominant in bar 4. From this perspective, the initial arpeggiation
forms part of a 6/4 to 5/3 motion over the dominant. The emphasis on V is
similar to the situation in the scherzo, where the opening phrase also functions
as an anacrusis to an imperfect cadence. The continuation of the main theme
(bars 5-11) prolongs the half-cadential V. The result is that an unequivocal
tonic enters only at the counterstatement of the opening material, which
supplies the emphatic F bass and full harmonisation thus far withheld (bar
12). Our previous strategy of using restatements as an aid to harmonic
interpretationis helpful here as well: the recapitulation supports the idea that
the initial phrase is part of a structural anacrusis to bar 12's climactic arrival.
The prominence of C in the head motive allows Brahms to bring back a
fragmentaryversion of the opening phrase within the retransitional dominant
(bars 160-64). (The dominant Stufeis initiated by the C minor statement of
the second theme at bar 150.) The dominant extends across the return of the

middle section (bars 166-72) and does not resolve until the entrance of the
counterstatement (bar 173). From a thematic perspective, the recapitulation
begins to emerge at bar 160. Yet through an explicit dominant harmonisation
of the head motive, Brahms more fully realises the function of his material as
preparationfor a delayed tonic articulation.6
The initial type 1 chords of the first and third movements demonstrate
Brahms's interest in motivic ideas that have built-in potential for multivalence.
The absence of harmonisation is crucial to his invention of material that is less
than clear-cut in harmonic function. Though a tonic attribution might be
our first inclination for an opening gesture that touches on i, 2 and/or 8,
Brahms hardly locks into a stable point of departure. Initial open-endedness
allows him room to explore less obvious consequences of his material, which
in turn influences our view of the original, as well as our encounters with it in
section repeats and in rehearings.A passage that illustrates Brahms's proclivity
for structural ambivalence, even when he is involved with more explicit type 1
chords, is the transition of the first movement. The need for forward
momentum makes the transition a logical place for a composer to loosen the
control of the tonic. Though it is not unusual for the 5-6 technique to
function in this capacity,7 Brahms's approach in the Quintet is of special
interest, both for its internal details and for its relationship to the movement's
thematic process. A score excerpt and two possible graphs of the passage
appear in Ex. 9. The situation is similar to the multivalent potential of the
main theme: the first graph interprets the F 6/3 chords in bars 23-5 as part of
a structural tonic; the second emphasises the appoggiatura character of the
chords in relation to the dominant. The tonic interpretation rests on our
ability to hear an elision of the F 5/3 chord that would normally enter before a
motion to 8. The strong cadential dominant that prepares the thematic
entrance supports this conceptualisation; so too do the similar progressions at
the return of the type 1 motive in bars 24, 25 and 29. What this interpretation
says, in terms of middleground structure, is that the big opening tonic remains
in effect all the way up to the final F 6/3 articulation at bar 29. Only after that
point does the progression move decisively away from F and on to the V/C#
that enters at bar 33.
I do not include the second graph to undermine the idea that the first part
of the transition remains under the control of the F Stufe. Rather, my intention
is to explore the character of this particular transitional destabilisation of an
opening structural tonic. An attribution of appoggiatura status to the F 6/3
chords is not difficult to defend when the influence of the top voice is taken
into account. The main melodic constituent is the DWC neighbour motive.
Rather than hear the F bass exclusively in relation to the big opening tonic, it
is possible to focus on a local context in which i functions as consonant
support for the D; dissonance. The impact of the motive is so strong that it

the exposition's second key (bar 35). The return of the neighbour motive - at
the new 8-8-8 level and in both the top voice and accompaniment encourages a connection with the opening. The process continues with the
shift to Db major for the closing material (bar 74). To some analysts, these
motivic connections might seem fairly straightforward.Yet a sceptic might
argue that it is one thing to relate the secondary key to the Db neighbour, but
quite another to assert a connection with the Db arpeggiation in bar 1; to hear
the arpeggiation as a VI chord is to sever the material from its tonal context.8
My response to this objection is twofold. First, we must recognise that even an
interpretationthat limits the motivic connection to a relationship between the
neighbour and the tonicisation has partially to ignore tonal context. As Ex. 10
shows, the Db of the second key is part of a motion that descends in thirds
from the tonic; it is not an enlarged neighbour. Second, Brahms connects the
tonicised Db with the Db arpeggiation, at the exposition repeat. Ex. 11 traces
the process, starting from the final cadence of the second group. An important
feature of the first ending is the F-GEAS fragment in bars 91a-92a. The figure
partly adumbratesthe modulation back to F, as does the 6/4 chord that results
from the bass motion to C in bar 94a.9 But the persistence of the Db tonic
makes it possible to hear the Gh as a raised 4. Thus, when the fragment is
reincorporatedinto the main theme at the repeat, it is not a decisive indication
of tonic return.l° Indeed, the new Db pickup at the close of the first ending
connects to the Dbsin bars 1-2. The result is a submediant bass as support for
the F and ASof the polyphonic melody. A motivic 6/3 chord, whose status as
an inversion might otherwise seem tenuous, is revealed to be the source for the
Db tonicisation. The similarity of this passage with the crossover from the
Andante into the scherzo is unmistakable.
These excerpts make it clear that the interconnection of type 1 motives and
the submediant is a characteristic shared by the first and third movements.

coda (bars 342-9). All three locations closely integrate VI with the tonic key.
The nearness of the tonic keeps the origin of the submediant alive, despite the
absence of type 1 motives.'1 The Andante, like the scherzo, transposes the
motivic third relation to accommodate a new tonal centre. Its middle section
(bars 35-55) is in Ehmajor, the flat submediant in relation to the movement's
A; major tonic. One possible motivation for the large-scale mixture is a desire
for a parallelismwith the original tonic-submediant relationship.The A; tonic
itself takes on a submediant function, when it carries over into the opening of
the scherzo, as previously outlined in Ex. 6. Special features of the scherzo's
coda join this ASlink to help articulate the I-III-V-I key scheme of the cycle
as a unifsed progression. Ex. 12 reproduces a representative excerpt. The
passage is noteworthy for both the major version of the C tonic and the return
of the motivic 6/3 chord at its original transposition level. The combination of
these characteristicsmakes the C tonic begin to sound like a dominant. The
new tonal orientation anticipates the return of F minor for the f1nale - a
continuity not unlike the earlier pivot function for AS at the crossover into the
scherzo. In addition to this prospective connection, the coda intensifies the
links between the scherzo and the first movement. This is most obvious in the
shift back from C 6/3 to F 6/3 chords. But a connection with the f1rst
movement is also encouraged by emphasis on the semiquaver fragment from
the scherzo's second theme. The motive is marked with an X in Ex. 12. A

glance back at Ex. 9a reveals the original source for the material:the transition
of the first movement, a passage similarly dominated by F 6/3 chords. The
connection throws light on our earlier debate about harmonic control in the
transition. The dependence, in the scherzo's coda, of F 6/3 chords on the C
major tonic retrospectively supports Ex. 9c's interpretation of type 1 motives
as appoggiaturasto the dominant.

The A major Violin Sonata, Op. 100
The prominence of D; as a key area in the Quintet provides a good example of
the relationship between motivic 6/3 chords and tonicisation. The situation is
noteworthy for the link between the DS key and the type 1 motive, at the
exposition repeat in the first movement. Brahms has other, more direct means
of connecting type 1 chords to tonicisations. The second movement of the A
major Violin Sonata provides an example of a more straightforward
relationship.12 The movement alternates between an Andante tranquillo
section in F major and a contrasting Vivace section in D minor. The form of
the whole articulates an AB-AB-AB pattern. Brahms achieves tonal closure by
transformingthe final B statement (bar 162) into a cadential flourish in F; the
material functions as a coda, ratherthan as a fully-fledged return. This closing
section, however, is hardly a simple confirmation of a harmonicfait accompli: it
resolves a tonal dialectic between F and D in which a motivic 6/3 chord plays a
central role.
The ambivalent relationship of F and D is partly a result of the absence of
transitional passages to connect the keys. Score annotations in Ex. 13 outline
Brahms's main method of modulation. In the final bars of the A section, the
fifth of the closing F tonic moves to a sixth to yield a type 1 6/3 chord. The
Vivace simply inverts the triad to root position and proceeds in D minor.
Given its temporal priority, we are likely to assume that F is the tonic for the
movement as a whole. As the alternation between the keys continues, however,
F and D acquire the characterof a third-relatedpair in stasis: it is not entirely
clear which tonic will take precedence. Brahms exploits the issue to create
momentum across a formal scheme that otherwise might tend toward
excessive sectionalisation.
A factor that contributes to the conflict between tonics is the motivic and
harmonic continuity at the onset of each section. Brahms uses his
to
KnupfFechnik complement the abrupt modulation at the entrance of the B
material:the head motive of the Vivace theme is an embellished version of the
violin's A-D fourth in the final bar of the A section (Ex. 13). The
sophistication of the linkage includes a reversal, across the entrance of bar 17,
of the A section's 5-6 motion. From the perspective of a passage in D minor,
there is nothing extraordinaryabout this voice leading, nor about the emphasis

on the resulting F major chord; the mediant is part of a standard I-III-V# bass
arpeggiation. For this particular movement, however, the situation has
enormous significance: it initiates a pattern in which the tonic of one section
overflows into the beginning of the next. At the entrance of the B material this
might not seem so unusual; at that point in the form, F has been established as
a clear tonic, presumably the tonic for the movement as a whole; a slight
weakening of the type-l-derived D minor only seems to confirm what we have
assumed to this point. But at each of the two returns of the Andante material,
D remains in force - not as a colouration of a new key like the F mediant in
the Vivace, but as an unambiguous tonic. The first A return (bar 72)
replicates, in D major, bars 1-5's modulation from tonic to dominant, before it
reintroduces F. The second return (bar 150) heightens the ambivalence
between F and D by alternatingbetween the keys: initially, D sounds as tonic
(bars 150-51); then the tonal focus briefly shifts to F, before V/D enters in the
second half of bar 153. The passage summarises what has become a tonal
issue for the movement as a whole, with one crucial difference: D is placed in
the superior position in the alternation. It seems as if Brahms is beginning to
favour the tonality that derives from the type 1 motive. The intuition continues
even after F emerges at bar 155 as tonic for the conclusion of the second A
return: when Brahms articulates the motivic 5-6 motion one last time (bars
160-61), it is hard to resist the thought that the pendulum is about to swing
back at the last moment in favour of D. Not until the coda, where the Vivace

an enlargement, within a single F Stufe,of the foreground 5-6 motions that
give rise to motivic 6/3 chords at bars 6 and 26. As in the Quintet, emphasis
on the submediant originates in an unharmonised Db neighbour in the very
opening bars (Ex. 15). Indeed, the scale pattern of the entire initial phrase,
with its adjustment of 2 to GS, anticipates the move to Db.'3The situation is
also remarkable for the pivot function of the Db area: the subsequent
modulation to C minor (bar 53) hinges on a reinterpretation of the F 6/3
chord as a Neapolitan to the dominant.

The influence of the motivic chord on the Sonata's tonal scheme extends
beyond the exposition's middle key. The submediant reemerges with greater
harmonic independence in the development. The climactic arrival at bar 120
articulates the root position submediant as tonic for a passage in C# minor.
The shift back to the major submediant at bar 129 facilitates the recapitulation
of the movement's opening phrase in the Neapolitan at bar 130. The F# minor
return of this material is an outgrowth of the GS in bar 4; the result is an
overlap between the development and the recapitulation. Despite the change
of key, however, the submediant remains the prolonged harmony; C# is
rearticulated at bar 134. The connection between the development's
submediant and the exposition's F 6/3 chords is clarifiedby the voice exchange
that follows. Fig. 1 outlines the process. The motion from VIF# to the 6/3
position at bar 136 corresponds with a respelling of the C# chord as Db. From
there, Brahms simply reverses the motivic 5-6 voice leading to reintroduce the
tonic and main theme at bar 138. He then immediately returns to the 6/3
chord as the theme continues with its original 5-6 motion.'4
The Clarinet Sonata demonstrates that harmonic consequences of motivic
6/3 chords need not be limited to tonicisation; type 1 motives can take on any

of the functions associated with the submediant To summarise: the movement
includes not only tonicisations of VI, in both first inversion (exposition) and
root position (development), but also a reinterpretationof the type 1 motive as
V/bII (development) and as a large-scale Neapolitan in the dominant key
(exposition).lf The V/;II usage points to another common function for the
submediant: the potential for the chord to link semitonally related keys via
either the familiar V7/German sixth equivalence or - as in the Clarinet Sonata
- a similar procedure more intimately connected to the motivic structure of a
movement. (As we have seen, the FFFF modulation at the recapitulation
hinges on a reversal of the characteristic 5-6 voice leading, rather than on
resolution of V7/F# as a German sixth chord.) Regardless of the modulatory
details, however, it is clear that key relation by semitone is an important
characteristicof the Sonata. The prominence of semitone relations marks the
movement as an example of what one recent commentator has labelled the
Neapolitan complex.l6 The idea of a Neapolitan complex is relevant because
there is a strong correlation, in Brahms, between motivic 6/3 chords and tonal
schemes that focus on semitone relations. Though analysts have long
recognised the importance of the submediant for the Neapolitan complex,l7
the special case in which the crucial VI harmony originates in a type 1 chord
has yet to be explored. We will continue to see the tendency for type 1 motives
to function as part of an emphasis on semitone-related keys in our final two
examples of type 1 usage: the C minor String Quartet and the Horn Trio.

The C minor String Quartet, Op. 51 No. 1
Up to this point, we have observed situations in which type 1 chords are
consequential for the key scheme of a single movement. The C minor Quartet
provides an example of a motivic 6/3 chord that blossoms into the tonic for an
entire later movement. The type 1 motive enters at the very outset of the cycle.
As outlined in Ex. 16, the context is noteworthy for penetration of the motive
into multiple dimensions, almost to the point of saturation.l8Unlike the Piano
Quintet and the Clarinet Sonata, the first movement avoids tonicisation of the

immediately followed by the first tonal delay: motivic 6/3 chords at bars 3 and
15 prevent resolution to an opening structuraltonic. The tonic does not enter
until bar 21, and even there the resolution is weak; continued thematic
instability defines the cadence as an anticipation of the rock-solid tonic that
finally enters at the structural downbeat of bar 33. As we shall see, Brahms

The finale, like the first movement, responds to an unstable main theme
with an extensive delay of tonic rearticulation at the recapitulation.23 is
It
appropriate first to comment on the similar key schemes of the two
development sections. Both developments centre around A minor and C#
minor. The type l motive plays a crucial role in the Neapolitan tonicisation of
each, similar to the situation in the development of the Clarinet Sonata.24In
the first movement, the motion to C# grows out of the 5-6 step sequence in
bars 108-l l. Ex. 20 provides an analysis of the modulation and highlights a
motivic connection with the type l chord of the main theme. The recall of the
opening phrase allows us to hear the G# dominant of bar l l l as a
reinterpretationof the original C 6/3 sonority. The new harmonic orientation
for the triad is solidified by the shift to root position for the cadential
dominants of bars l l 5, l l 7 and l 2 l . In the finale, the connection of VIC#with
the C 6/3 motive is more direct. The type l harmony dominates the rondo
refrain that follows the exposition (bars 94-lOl). Brahms simply shifts the
triad into root position and respells it as G# to lead into the Neapolitan at

articulatingthe return of the tonic chord itself, since the second key area (bars
141-91) prolongs V/C.25
The situation sets the stage for an apotheosis of the idea of type 1 chords as
agents of tonal delay. The final refrain continues to subvert potential points of
resolution by means of the type 1 motive (bars 202-3 and 221-4). But now it
is not a matter of delay simply within the main theme; the dominant
prolongation extends the delay that stretches across the entire recapitulation.
This is where we see the main theme's structuraldownbeat reinterpretedas an
agent of tonal closure. Brahms approaches the closing tonic of bar 231 with
material analogous to the counterstatement of the opening idea (bars 15-20 =
bars 225-30). In the exposition, the cadential progression at the end of this
formal unit resolves weakly, as previously described. At the end of the
movement, Brahms takes advantage of the cumulative character of the
cadential material, but he provides a conclusive resolution immediately, by
proceeding directly to material analogous to bar 33. A fourteen-bar tonic pedal
leaves no doubt that we have finally arrivedat our long awaited tonal goal. It is
interesting to note that Brahms is unable, even at the decisive arrival (bar
231), to resist motion to AN.In this context, though, 8 clearly functions within
tonic expansion. The cadential phrase similarly injects an element of motivic
discharge. The final motion to closure touches on an augmented sixth chord
(bar 229), a factor that is in itself unremarkable. But within a movement indeed within a cycle - that is so tightly integrated motivically, the chord can
be heard as a transformation of the type 1 idea.26 Brahms 'liquidates' a
characteristicfunction of his motive - its tendency to delay tonic articulationin favour of generic identity within a standard cadential progression.

The El7
major Horn Trio, Op. 40
Our final type 1 example, the finale of the Horn Trio, introduces a new
context into the discussion: the 6/3 chord enters in bar 46, just after the bifocal close of the main theme (bar 43); the sustained bass is 8 rather than i'.
The passage demonstrates the potential for a type 1 chord to function in a
major-mode sonata form; up to this point, all sonata form examples have been
in minor. The formal outline in Table 2 will facilitate discussion of the type 1
motive as it reappears in different guises throughout the second group. The
motive and its transformations are again central to the delay of a structural
harmony, in this case the tonicised dominant. As the graph in Ex. 21
illustrates,a middleground B; chord does not enter until the structuralclose of
the exposition (bar 83). The context for the entrance of the motive at bar 46 is
similarto the opening of the Piano Quintet's scherzo: there too a motivic 6/3
chord enters after reiterations of an unharmonised bass. (Other similarities
include the subsequent pedal function of the bass, the expression of the

motivic chord as an ascending arpeggiation, and the 6/8 metre.) The
difference here is that the implied B; 5/3 chord is major. The shift to D; and G;
produces an apparent WVI
chord that is analogous to the type 1 motive in the
Quintet, as well as in our other minor-mode examples. As the analysis
proceeds, it will become clear that this particularform of the 5-6 technique the pairing of major triads whose roots are a major third apart - has important
mot1v1c
consequences.
Throughout the first subphrase (bars 45-52), all aspects of the tonal
structure define G; as a neighbour to F. The linear character of Wg
denies the
6/3 chord status as an inversion. The tonicisation of the submediant within the
second subphrase (bar 55), by contrast, allows the apparentWVI resonate in
to
the harmonic dimension. The motion to Ahin the bass changes the motivic
sonority to minor. (The shift to double mixture motivates the spelling of bars
55-60 in F#minor.27) noteworthy aspect of the passage is the contribution of
A
the bass to oche
duality of linear and harmonic tendencies for the type 1 motive.
At the very point that Ngbegins to have harmonic influence, the lower voice
shifts to a linear orientation:the Ahinitiates a bass passing motion to F (This is

the fourth progression labelled in the graph). The combination of Blw
mobility
and DIG; invariance retrospectively affects our interpretation of the original
type 1 chord. Prolongational hearing defines the original and tonicised 6/3
chords as distinct entities: the first results from the 5-6 technique, the second
from a passing motion in the bass. Associative hearing, by contrast, permits an
identity relationship: though the bass Blw
and Ah have distinct voice-leading
functions, they hold analogous positions within the same motivic triad.
Through a kind of interpretativetransitivity,the initial 6/3 chord shares in the
new harmonic status of F#/GS: Blw = Ah6/3 with a shift in quality, and Ah
if 6/3
6/3 = inversion of a local F# tonic, then it must be possible - at least partly and
in retrospect- to hear Blw as an inversion with G; as root.
6/3
Following the F# tonicisation, the second group temporarily turns away
from the type 1 chord. The influence of the motive is limited to repetitions of
its 8Ag neighbour until the final approach to closure. (A good example of the
independence of the neighbour from its original harmonisation is the GWF
alternation in the top voice of bars 61-3; another is the enlarged major version
of the 8-8-8 figure that follows immediately after the arrival on IIqat bar 67
(Ex. 21).) Not until the final subphrase (bars 75-82) does the 8Ag constituent
reconnect with the type 1 motive. Up to this point, the harmonic influence of
the 6/3 chord is limited to the F# tonicisation. The closing passage introduces
two additional harmonic functions. The GSneighbour appears, expanded and
in the bass, as support for a progression centred around the V7/German sixth
equivalence. This is another example of the potential for a type 1 motive to
connect semitone-related keys, as seen in the Clarinet Sonata and the String
Quartet. In the first part of the passage (bars 75-8), the root position version
of the motivic chord functions as the dominant of BFminor. The second part
(bars 79-82) reinterprets the harmony as a German sixth in Bl>. The
augmented sixth prepares the return of the middleground IIq, which finally
resolves to the long awaited Blw
structuralharmony. The absence of a dominant
5/3 chord between the cadential 6/4 and the Blw
tonic (bars 81-3) creates a
direct connection between resolution of the motivic harmony and arrivalat the
tonal goal.
As in our other examples, the influence of the type 1 motive extends beyond
the confines of any single formal section. The retransition(bars 143-68) is one
area in which the motive returns with great emphasis. A look at the passage
will help to connect the type 1 usage in the finale with the cyclic integration of
the whole. Throughout we will see that the chromatic status of the motive and
its derivatives contributes to their distinctiveness and thus to their ability to
unify the cycle. The arrivalof the home dominant articulates the beginning of
the retransition, which divides into three sections: an antecedent phrase (bars
145-51), a consequent phrase (bars 153-61) and a final anacrusis passage
(bars 161-8). The initial tonal gesture of the antecedent is the same motivic

8Ag motion over Bl>.
The rising arpeggiationin the piano accompaniment joins
the mixture to cement a connection with the second group. In contrast to the
earlier section, however - where the neighbour figure and harmonic
consequences are stressed - the retransition extracts the 8Ag pattern as a
source for development. The voice leading becomes the model for a sequential
pattern in both the antecedent and consequent. In the antecedent, the
sequence breaks off after five bars to allow for a cadential arrival back on Blw
(bar 151). The consequent, on the other hand, adjusts the continuation, so
that the passage arpeggiates through an augmented triad. Ex. 22 presents a
schematic version of the voice leading. Each stage of the sequence replicates
the pairing, of major triads separated by major third, of the original 8Ag
motion. Brackets and X labels beneath the reduction clarify this. The final
repetition of the pattern - the motion from Dq to Blw occurs in the anacrusis
passage that leads into the recapitulation.

The retransitionalfunction of the DEB; pair is one way in which the finale
contributes to the unity of the cycle. Within the movement itself, the strategy
is motivic: DW also a central component of the tonic return toward the end of
is
the main theme. In bar 25, DW
enters as V of a locally tonicised Ghminor. A
mini G-C-F circle of fifths progression in bars 33-4 is all that separates DW
from a direct progression to the home dominant. The similarity of the passage
with the retransition becomes even more obvious in the recapitulation:in the
new formal context, the V/Ghto V/EIX
progression within the main theme (bars
193-202) echoes the situation in the retransition.The link is strengthened by a
hint of the mediant key in the retransition. There a V/Ghfunction arises both
from the parallelismof DW
with the B; dominant of the antecedent (cf. bars 151
and 161) and from the DEGhprogression in bars 157-9.
These idiosyncratic retransitionaltechniques forge a close tie with strategies
of tonal return in the first movement, where we also see emphasis on the DEB;
type 1 pair. The retransitions in the first movement are part of an unusual
AB-AB-A formal scheme. The first B section (bars 77-130) expresses the

contrasting key of Gh minor largely through emphasis on the motivic DW
dominant. The progression from this V/Ghback to the home dominant at bar
127 is virtually identical to the harmonic motion just prior to the
recapitulation in the finale. The main difference is that the prolonged DW
bass
makes the voice leading even more like the motivic 8Ag pattern. The same
progression also governs the retransition to the final refrain, but a new tonal
context expands the network of inter-movement connection. The second B
section (bars 167-99) transposes the material to BS minor. Rather than alter
the end of the restatement to prepare for a return of the tonic key, Brahms
maintains a strict parallelism: V/BSleads to V/G; in bars 195-6, just as V/Gh
led to V/EDin the earlier passage. The final A refrain (bar 200) thus begins
with a tonicisation of the GSchord that will later receive emphasis as a type 1
motive. Indeed, the first movement signals the importance of G; from the
outset. Its first modulation- a small-scale tonicisation within the A section - is
to WIII
(bars 37-43). The beginning of the BSminor B section also touches on
G; (bars 167-73). All three points of emphasis establish G; as a source for
inter-movement connection with subsequent type 1 motives.28
The reappearance of GS in the guise of a type 1 chord in the finale raises
important issues about the relationshipbetween motivic 6/3 chords and sonata
form. Brahms's treatment of the type 1 motive in the finale also forges
connections with the other sonata form in the cycle, the big A section of the
scherzo. Both movements articulate their motivic 6/3 chords as part of largescale dissonance; according to the sonata principle, in Edward T. Cone's
words, the dissonant section 'must either be re-stated in the tonic, or brought
into a closer relation with the tonic, before the movement ends'.29
The method
of resolution in the finale is straightforward: recapitulation transposes the
the
type 1 material to the tonic level (bars 213-59). It might be possible for this
new version alone to provide tonal reconciliation. Brahms nevertheless returns
to the CS form of the type 1 motive in the coda. The chord appears twice
within the approach to the closing structural tonic (bars 267 and 271). The
second SVI participates in a deceptive progression that helps to create the
powerful sense of arrival at the tonic resolution of bar 277. It is in this sense
that the coda carries the idea of tonal reconciliation to a logical conclusion.
The situation in the scherzo is similar, both with respect to the dissonant
status of the type 1 material and its resolution later in the movement. Table 3
summarises the formal layout of the movement's A section.30The scherzo also
introduces G; via a 8Ag motion in the dominant key area (bar 61). The type 1
chord forms part of the head motive for a parallelperiod toward the end of the
second group (bars 61-8 and 69-77). The antecedent and consequent of this
phrase both lead to cadential progressions by transformingthe GSsubmediant
into an augmented sixth chord. The second of these cadences articulates the

structural close of the exposition. Thus in terms of both harmonic progression
and formal location, the usage is analogous to the function of the motive in the
finale. The relationship also includes resolution of the type 1 material at the CS
level later in the movement. An expanded version of the parallel period (bars
227-71) culminates in the structural close not only for the A section, but also
- following the da capo - for the movement as a whole.
The prominence of CSin the approach to closure in the scherzo and finale
also relates to another shared aspect of tonal organisation. The scherzo is the
more straightforwardcase so let us begin there. We have previously noted the
tendency for motivic 6/3 chords to take on harmonic functions associated with
the submediant, including the enharmonically equivalent V7 and German
sixth transformations.The scherzo exploits this duality to emphasise semitonerelated keys, just as we have seen in other type 1 contexts. As noted above,
Brahms uses the augmented sixth transformation to approach cadential
major episode at the
dominants within the BS key area. It is not until the BW
heart of the development (bars 121-53) that GSitself functions as a dominant.
(Prominent statements of the motivic chord in its new function as V/Bhoccur
at bars 120, 125, 143 and 151.) The aforementioned return of CS in the
major
approach to closure can be heard as a rapprochement of this BW

tonicisation with the home key, in addition to the more direct relationship the
material forms with the end of the second group. The situation in the finale is
similar. We have already seen that Brahms takes advantage of the V7/German
sixth equivalence to hint at the Neapolitan key of BW prior to the close of
just
the exposition. He picks up BW
again in the development (bars 111-1 9) .
(Interestingly enough, the motion to BW
engages the same V/Ghchord that is
prominent in so many other transitional passages.) Though the development
reinterprets BW V/EW, passage still forms an associative connection with
as
the
the second group. Because the emphasis on BW not nearly as strong as in the
is
scherzo, the need for resolution is much less intense. The prominence of SVIin
the recapitulation and coda can nevertheless be heard as a response to both
the type 1 motive and the BW
harmony.
Type 2 6/3 chords
Now that we have a clear idea of Brahms's type 1 strategies, we are in a
position to explore type 2 6/3 chords and their relationship to the first
category. The BSminor Intermezzo, the Tragic Overture and the finale of the
F major Viola Quintet each begin with a 6/3 chord that functions as an
inversion of the tonic. A glance back at Ex. 2 refreshes our memory of the
parallel 6/3 chords that initiate the Intermezzo. Ex. 23 shows type 2 chords in
the opening mottos of the Overture and Quintet. Normally we think of the two
chord types as distinct in origin and function. To repeat the Schenkerian view
put forward at the outset of this study: type 1 chords arise out of a linear
motion above a stationary tonic bass - the 6/3 chords do not have harmonic
significance; type 2 chords, on the other hand, are harmonic in orientation they extend or represent the 5/3 chords from which they are generated through
inversion. Yet we have seen that Brahms uses the apparent submediant of his
type 1 motives as a topic for development; this function grants linear 6/3
chords status as inversions. The type 2 examples similarly demonstrate that
first inversion tonics can exhibit characteristicsthat we normally associate with
the type 1 category. Specifically, all three pieces express intriguing
relationshipsbetween their 6/3 chords and the mediant harmony. This is most
immediately apparent in the Overture: the F bass of the I6 initiates an
arpeggiationof III in the lower voice (Ex. 23a). Because a dominant intervenes
between the opening tonic and the F major chord at bar 3, the progression is
not a straightforward
6-5 motion. The same F harmony, though, does connect
directly to the motto at its return in bar 4: F and A remain as common tones
and D replaces C, similar to a type 1 5-6 alternation. A slightly different form
of emphasis on the mediant occurs when V6/5/IIIprepares the rearticulationof
I6 on the downbeat of bar 9.
We have seen that Brahms consistently uses type 1 motives to generate

relationship across the first and second groups. Yet in the Quintet, the choice
of III#for the second key - though certainly not without precedent32 is itself a
'characteristic'feature; a motivic association with the motto is plausible on its
own terms, especially if one considers the importance of the mediant major
throughout the cycle.33(I will return to the issue of III#in the other movements
shortly.) The key scheme of the Overture, by contrast, follows formal
convention; we need additional evidence to support the proposed relationship.
A passage that bolsters a motivic interpretationcomes at the end of the second
group - a context that is similar to the exposition repeat in the first movement
of the Piano Quintet. Instead of a repeat, what we have in the Overture is a
partial restatement of the main theme prior to the development (bars
185-209).34 This abridged refrain provides an opportunity for a direct
connection between the tonicised mediant and the motto. The retransition of
bars 181-4 isolates F and A from the closing F tonic of the second group.
These pitches are joined by D at the arrivalback at the opening material (bar
185). Though Brahms highlights the reentry of D by putting it in the bass, the
restatement is part of a prolongation of the mediant: F returns to the lower
voice for the repetitions of the motto in bars 187 and 190 and the phrase
culminates back on III at bar 196. The new tonal context transformswhat was
originally a type 2 chord into a type 1 chord: within an F Stufe,D functions as
a displacement of the C fifth, rather than as a root transferred to an upper
voice.

The Viola Quintet demonstrates another similarity between Brahms's
approach to type 1 and type 2 6/3 chords: a key scheme that interacts with a
type 2 harmony tends also to participate in cyclic unification. Though the first
two movements of the Quintet do not contain type 2 motives, the key of A
major has a central role in each. The first movement, like the finale, adopts III#
as the key for its second theme group (bar 46). The second movement
emphasises A major within a different formal context. A brief digression into
the organisation of the movement will suffice to demonstrate a connection
with the type 2 motive of the finale. The movement's form is based on an
alternationbetween a slow A section and a fast B section, very much along the
lines of the middle movement of the A major Violin Sonata. Another similarity
with the Sonata is the issue Brahms raises regardingwhich of the tonics of the
two sections will take precedence as the tonal centre for the movement as a
whole. In this case, the third-related keys are C# minor and the motivic A
major. In the Violin Sonata, the key of the A section eventuallywins out. Here,
however, the A major of the B section emerges as the closing tonic at the very
end of the final A restatement (bars 196-208).35 The last-minute shift to A
major comes just in time to prepare the A bass of the finale's opening tonic
6/3. The continuity in the cello line across the movements supports the idea of
a motivic connection between the finale's A major second key and the I6

wish to overstate my case for a motivic association. The B7minor Intermezzo,
by contrast, articulates a more forthright connection. A crucial difference in
the Intermezzo is that its A section avoids a tonic 5/3. This allows the bass of
the type 2 motive to remain availablefor a prolongational connection with the
mediant of the B section. Ex. 24 traces the bass-line continuity across the
formal units. The representationis based on Schenker's unpublished graph of
the Intermezzo, an analysis that was recently brought to the attention of the
music theory community by Allen Cadwallader.36
The situation is similar to
the tonal relationships in the exposition of the Clarinet Sonata. In the Sonata,
the F bass of the D7 key area is an offshoot of the F bass of the opening
structuraltonic (Ex. 14). In the Intermezzo, the D7 bass of the B section is an
offshoot of the D7 bass of the opening 6/3 chord. What I would like to add to
Cadwallader's exegesis is attention to the tension between the structural
significance of the opening tonic and the lack of articulative strength for any
particular B7 chord until the final cadence. Of special interest is the weakness
of the tonic when compared to the more solidly articulated relative major.
Despite the tonic function of the opening 6/3 chord, the progression into the B
section resembles a 6-5 motion over a stationary bass. Normally the 5/3 chord
is the controlling harmony in this type of structure. In the Clarinet Sonata, for
example, the 6/3 chord of the second key depends on the opening tonic. But in
the Intermezzo, the tonicised mediant takes the more stable perfect

consonance. It is almost as if the tonic 6/3 depends on the mediant. The
reversal is enforced by the greater harmonic stability of the D; area. Though
both A and B sections consist of parallel periods, the Bb material avoids
dominant preparation for its tonic 6/3 chords at bars 1 and 10. Indeed, the
emphasis on the C-G; tritone in the preparatory II6 chords hints at the
connection of I6 to the mediant. By contrast, the antecedent and consequent
of the B section (bars 23 and 31) not only both depart from a root position DS
tonic; they each also approach the harmony from a root position dominant.
The authentic cadence that closes the middle section at bar 38 conf1rmsthe
superior strength of the mediant.
Brahms follows the tonal imbalance of the A and B sections with an A'
section that also shifts the weight of emphasis off the tonic. The result is that
the type 2 motives participate in a delay of solid tonic articulation until the
structural close (bar 83). Because the A' material has some of the
characteristics of a recapitulation, it will be helpful to mix sonata form
terminology into discussion of this process of delay. Annotations beneath the
graph in Ex. 24 illustrate the correlation of ternary and sonata attributes.
Before we consider new elements of instability in the reprise, it is first
important to observe the apparent tonic that enters at the beginning of the
retransition (bar 39). Ex. 25 reproduces Cadwallader's analysis of the
passage.38 his graph shows, the apparent BStonic results from a 5-6 motion
As
above a prolongation of the B section's DSbass. The foreground connection of
DS and B; harmonies parallels the middleground progression across the A and
B sections. The fact that Brahms hints at the tonic return with a type 1 chord
supports the idea that the original modulation resembles a 6-5 motion.
If we return to Ex. 24, we see that the home dominant at bar 48 prepares
the thematic return. Brahms nevertheless undercuts tonic rearticulation
through an ingenious blend of restatement and recomposition. He replaces the
I6/3 point of departure of the A section with a V6151IV
chord (bar 52). The
result is that the thematic reprise prolongs the retransitional dominant up to
the half-cadential V toward the end of the antecedent (bar 57). This is why
Ex. 24 locates a tonic rearticulation only at bar 61. The character of the
recomposed consequent extends the tonal instability of this formal overlap.
The phrase does not provide a structuralafterbeatto confirm the tonal return.
Rather it immediately merges into a structural anacrusis that prepares the
climactic dominant at bar 69. Otherwise, there are no other structural tonics
in the A' section. The recapitulation of the B section/second group (bar 73)
sustains the dominant emphasis, as illustrated in Ex. 24. Brahms's strategy for
the return of the material centres around dual purposes. One function is to
bring the second theme into closer relation to the tonic key through
transposition to BS.Yet Brahms counterbalances this element of reconciliation
by refusing to relent to a root position tonic chord until the last possible

Conclusion
I began this study by drawing a sharp distinction between type 1 and type 2
6/3 chords. Part of the interest in the topic, however, lies precisely in
relationshipsthat transcend these analytical categories. It is without question a
sign of progress that we have moved beyond the days when chords of both
types could be lumped together indiscriminately as examples of first inversion
triads. Brahmss motivic invention nevertheless contradicts the assumption
that these two subcategories are mutually exclusive. How then should we deal
with the apparent illogic of a 6/3 chord that can be both the result of a 5-6
motion and an inversion with the third in the bass? First we can categorise our
analyticaldescriptions as either primary or secondary hearings. The 6/3 chords
in the first group of pieces that I dealt with are primarily type 1 motives with
secondary type 2 characteristics;for the second group, it is just the reverse. We
can also accommodate seemingly contradictory analytical statements by
focusing on multiple listening perspectives. That is to say, the contradictions
evaporate when it is clear that we are dealing with perceptions that arise at
different temporal locations in a piece.39Yet another alternative is to focus on
rehearings of the same event, with different theoretical models functioning as
the primaryheuristic frameworkfor each encounter. In any case, it is clear that
to evaluate a motivic 6/3 chord from only one perspective - be it the local
vertical slices of traditional harmonic analysis or the synoptic perspective of a
Schenker graph - would be to turn our back on the very dynamism for which
Brahms is rightly celebrated.
NOTES
1. Joseph Dubiel explores the function of a type 1 chord to postpone the appearance
of a stable tonic in 'Contradictory Criteria in a Work of Brahms', in David
Brodbeck (ed.), Brahms
Studies,
vol. 1 (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press,
1994), pp. 81-110. The work he analyses, the D minor Piano Concerto, Op. 15,
begins with perhaps the most famous example of a type 1 chord in Brahms's
aeuvre.
2. Throughout this study, when I identify a chord by pitch-class label I will use the
bass pitch, not the chord root. For example, I will refer to the Quintet scherzo's
type 1 motive as a C 6/3 chord and the Intermezzo's type 2 motive as a Db 6/3
chord. When I do wish to refer to harmonic function I will do so via Roman
numerals. This will help avoid confusion in cases like the scherzo, where triadic
structure and harmonic function diverge.
3. Similar usages of the type 1 motive occur in the retransitionof bars 124-45, first
as embellishment to V/III and then as part of the return to the home dominant.
The final C 6/3 chord of the retransition (bars 144-5) is an exception to the
tendency for the material to appear as part of dominant prolongation: the
arpeggiation leads to an expanded tonic in bars 146-50. The twice-stated circle-

of-fifths sequence that follows confirms the shift to tonic prolongation. Yet even in
the context of this tonic expansion, it is still possible to hear a similarity with
earlier dominant contexts. The final C 6/3 chord of bar 144 prevents direct
resolution of the retransitional dominant. Moreover, the sequence delays the
arrival of the closing structural tonic until the coda: the tonic that enters at bar
146 functions as an anticipation of the decisive resolution at bar 158.
4. My emphasis on temporality and multivalence is inspired by Edward T. Cone's
and David Lewin's critiques of the tendency for music theorists to regard as
definitive analyticalstatements that are rendered from a synoptic perspective. (See
Cone, 'Three Ways of Reading a Detective Story - Or a Brahms Intermezzo', in
Music: A Viezvfrom Delft, ed. Robert P. Morgan (Chicago: The University of
Chicago Press, 1989), pp. 77-93; and Lewin, 'Music Theory, Phenomenology,
3
and Modes of Perception', Music Perception, (1986), pp. 327-92.) I apply the
analytical methodology that Lewin develops to counter this tendency in my
'StructuralTonic or Apparent Tonic?: ParametricConflict, Temporal Perspective,
and a Continuum of ArticulativePossibilities',ffournalof Music Theory,39 (1995),
pp. 245-83.
5. Another good example of a type 1 chord that is preparedby the closing cadence of
the previous movement is the head motive of the finale of the B major Trio, Op. 8
(revised version). The movement begins directly on its type 1 motive with G in
the top voice. One way to interpret the departure from G is as part of a 5-6
motion in which the fifth has been elided. Another is to hear the 5-6 motion
initiated by the closing B tonic of the slow movement, with its prominent F# in the
top voice.
6. This interpretationof the main theme and its recapitulationsummarises the more
detailed analysis I present in 'StructuralTonic or ApparentTonic?', pp. 270-72.
7. Edward Aldwell and Carl Schachter discuss the 5-6 technique as an agent of
Leading, 2nd edn (San Diego: Harcourt Brace
modulation in Harmonyand Voice
Jovanovich, 1989), pp. 200-202.
8. John Rothgeb, for example, asserts that 'Only one triad controls the first two bars
of the quintet, namely the F minor tonic triad; the Db is an upper neighbor to the
tonic's fifth - regardless of the extent to which the notation presents the visual
image of a Db triad' (review of Walter Frisch, Brahms and the Principle of
Developing Variation(Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984), in Music
TheorySpectrum,9 (1987), p. 211, n. 8).
9. Preparation by the 6/4 chord in the first ending also lends support to an
interpretationof bars 1-4 as a 6/4 to 5/3 motion within the dominant.
10. The ability to hear both the F-GEAN fragment and the 6/4 chord within a
continuation of Db is supported by bars 78-80 of the Db key area. The passage
articulates these two references to the main theme within a clear expansion
of a D; tonic. Other statements of Gqin the Dbcontext occur in the VII6/5/Vchords
at bars 86 and 88. Roger Graybill discusses these aspects of continuity
between the Db area and the exposition repeat in 'Brahms's Three-Key
Expositions: Their Place within the Classical Tradition' (PhD diss., Yale

University, 1983), pp. 350-53.
11. The finale does include prominent statements of a motivic 6/3 chord just prior to
the arrival of the second theme group (bars 91-2). The addition of FXto the
sonority is similar to the XIV7/;3
transformationin bar 43 of the scherzo. Here too
the motive functions as part of a dominant prolongation, in this case V/C. In the
recapitulation,the same material appears at the tonic level (bars 249-50).
12. My approach to the movement is similar to the sensitive and somewhat more
detailed analysis presented by Margaret Notley in 'Brahms's Chamber-Music
Summer of 1886: A Study of Opera 99, 100, 101, and 108' (PhD diss., Yale
University, 1992), pp. 82-107. Carl Schachter's brief comments on the piece are
also consonant with the main thrust of my argument ('Analysis by IRey:Another
Look at Modulation', MusicAnalysis,6 (1987), pp. 294-5).
13. The harmonisation of the return of the opening material in bars 19-24 confirms
the association with the Db area. The motivic 6/3 chord at the outset of this
passage makes the connection especially strong. Roger Graybill discusses aspects
of the tonic area that anticipate the modulation to Db in 'Brahms's Integration of
Traditional and Progressive Tendencies: A Look at Three Sonata Expositions',
70urnal of Musicological
Research,8 (1988), pp. 143-7. For a detailed look at the
entire movement, see my 'Brahms and the Neapolitan Complex: WII,
bVI, and
Their Multiple Functions in the First Movement of the F minor Clarinet Sonata',
in David Brodbeck (ed.), BrahmsStudies,vol. 2 (Lincoln: University of Nebraska
Press, forthcoming).
14. James Webster discusses this unusual retransition in 'The General and the
Particularin Brahms's Later Sonata Forms', in George S. Bozarth (ed.), Brahms
Studies: Analytical and Historical Perspectives
(Oxford: Oxford University Press,
1990), pp. 69-72. See also the discussion in my 'Brahms and the Neapolitan
Complex'.
15. A foreground example of the bII/Vfunction for a motivic 6/3 chord can be found
in the finale of the B major Trio, Op. 8 (revised version). In bars 30-33, a twicerepeated V4/21VI
chord embellishes the type 1 motive. Brahms then reinterprets
the (weakly) tonicised VI6 as WII6 the FX
in
cadential progression of bars 33-7.

23. The movement is an example of one of Brahms's favourite Mischformen, special
type of sonata-rondo hybrid that he likely learned from his studies of Mozart.
Robert Pascall labels this type of movement a sonata form with conflated
response ('Some Special Uses of Sonata Form by Brahms', Soundings,4 (1974),
pp. 58-63). On the relationshipbetween Brahms's and Mozart's formal strategies,
see John Daverio, 'From "Concertante Rondo" to "Lyric Sonata": A
Commentary on Brahms's Reception of Mozart', in Brodbeck (ed.), Brahms
Studies,vol. 1, pp. 111-38. Daverio interprets Brahms's formal hybrids from the
perspective of the aesthetic theories of Friedrich Schlegel in Nineteenth-Century
Music and the GermanRomanticIdeology(New York:Schirmer, 1993), pp. 127-54.

25. The dominant prolongation of the second key area is another feature that the
finale shares with the first movement. I explore the tendency for Brahms to use
this kind of second group as part of a delay of tonic return until the structural
close in 'Brahms and Schenker', pp. 95-103.
26. The parallelism with the chord above C in bar 227 strengthens the motivic
connection.
27. Edward Aldwell and Carl Schachter develop the category of double mixture in
Harmony and VoiceLeading, pp. 503-8. The term refers to the adjustment in
quality of a chord that is borrowed from the parallel mode. Thus the major bVI
chord that is borrowed from Bbminor becomes a minor bVIchord.

28. In this regard, it is interesting to note that the Eb minor Adagio mesto absorbs
Gbinto the tonic chord itself. bSreceives special emphasis as bass for the opening
tonic 6/3 chord. The movement, like the first, also makes its first modulation to
Gbmajor (bar 10). A closer look at the Adagio is unfortunately beyond the scope
of this study.
29. Cone, MusicalFormand MusicalPerformance
(New York:Norton, 1968), p. 77.
30. The A section is another example of the sonata-rondo hybrid that we saw in the
finale of the C minor String Quartet. Neither Daverio nor Pascall include the A
section in their lists of Brahms's sonata-rondo Mischformen.
They most likely omit
it because it is part of a largerternary form and not an independent movement in
its own right. It nevertheless exhibits all of the characteristicsthat Daverio and
Pascall associate with this special sonata-form variant. In addition to type 1
motives and sonata-form procedures, the A section and the finale also share a
'hunt-like' characterand similar techniques of metric-rhythmicorganisation. Both
movements are strongly hypermetric and the larger rhythmic groupings make the
scherzo's 3/4 metre sound not unlike the 6/8 of the finale.
31. In the Quintet, this occurs almost immediately with the emphasis on i in the
fugue subject (Ex. 23b); a more emphatic tonic arrives at the homophonic climax
toward the end of the first group (bar 23). The Overture'smotto is part of a delay
that pushes the arrivalof a tonic 5/3 ahead to bar 21.
32. Among Brahms's works, the first movement of the Third Symphony is another
example of a major-mode exposition with a I-IIIXkey scheme. Perhaps the most
famous example is the first movement of the Waldstein
Sonata.
33. With respect to the similarity of type 1 and type 2 usage, it is interesting to note
that the A major tonic and the main theme's 6/3 chord reverse the progression in
the Horn Trio from the Bb tonicised dominant to its type 1 offshoot. Both
progressionsinvolve major triads whose roots are separatedby a major third.
34. The return of the main theme is part of a conflation of recapitulatory and
developmental functions in the second part of the form. The general formal
strategy is similar to the finale of the C minor String Quartet and the scherzo of
the Horn Trio: the first part of the main theme returns in the tonic following the
exposition (bars 185-209); the partial restatement is followed by a passage that
doubles as recapitulation and development of the remaining material of the first
group and transition (bars 209-99); the recomposed transition preparesthe return
of the second theme at the tonic level for the resumption of the recapitulation
proper (bar 300). For an interesting discussion of these formal relationships, see
James Webster, 'Brahms's Tragic Overture:The Form of Tragedy', in Robert
Pascall (ed.), Brahms: Biographical, Documentary and Analytical Studies
(Cambridge:Cambridge University Press, 1983), pp. 99-124.
35. Like the movement in the Violin Sonata, the last refrain of the A section also
begins in the key of the B section. For a detailed analysis of the movement, see
