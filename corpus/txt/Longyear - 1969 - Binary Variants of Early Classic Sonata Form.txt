no perfect cadence to the tonic preceding this return, and a
second type in which these phenomena do not occur.
Of the 70
sonatas published between 1742 and 1774 in his sample, 57%
are in the first category.
The remaining 43% show a variety
of approaches, but only 17% contain no return of the exposition
in the home tonic. We can thus infer that only 17% of the first
sonata-form
movements in the keyboard sonatas in the period
under discussion will be in truly binary form. *3
Kamien has also shown that throughout the period of the sonatas
he has examined there is no significant divergence in binary
or ternary procedure between early and later examples comparable to the differing treatments of the exposition. *4 Inthe
most recent detailed investigation of the views on sonata form
Ritzel concluded that "the investigatheorists,
by Classic-era
tion of the second part of a [movement] is dissatisfying in Classic-era theory". *5 In the principal primary source that Ritzel
overlooked, Francesco Galeazzi's
Elementi Teorico-Practici
di Musica (Volume II, 1796), the emphasis is on the conventional "exposition-development-recapitulation"
idea with the
admission that the recapitulation can be curtailed by being begun with what we would call the "second theme" in order to
avoid a composition which would be too long. *6
The most common variant of sonata form which would fit a
mathematical definition of "binary" is not a true binary sonata
form at all. Prout has defined this form as "abridged sonata
form", in which after the close of the exposition in the dominant or related key the exposition is recapitulated in the tonic,
with no development or, at the most, a few measures to serve
as a bridge passage from exposition to recapitulation,
from
dominant to tonic. *7 A representative
early Classic illustration of this "abridged sonata form" is the first movement of
Domenico Alberti's F major cembalo sonata, II1 in WSrmann's
thematic catalogue. *8 Three measures (22-24), based on the
opening of the first theme, serve to lead from the exposition,
ending in the dominant, to the recapitulation,
beginning in the
tonic.
There are interesting subsidiary tonal axes in this
movement: supertonic in the transition (mm. 10-11) balanced
by major and minor forms of the subdominant in the recapitulation (mm. 29-30); tonic minor in the "second theme area" (mm.
15-17; 41-43) and the flatted submediant of the new key (m. 14)
balanced by flatted submediant of the tonic (mm. 37, 39).
The true binary sonata form is identifiable by the following
characteristics
which supplement the descriptions cited above

passages through the subdominant of the opening tonic (iv of D
minor = ii in F major) in a large-scale
ii-V-I progression in
F major.
The second part of the movement, not demarcated
by a double bar, begins (m. 88) with the opening idea which is
repeated (mm. 96-103) in G minor, the subdominant of the original key. Then a true development, defined as "[working] the
ideas in some motivic or organic fashion, by dissecting,
reforming, compounding, or interchanging them"*21, and incorporating modulation, motivic play, and contrapuntal treatment,
replaces the transitional sequences of mm. 17-31. The eventual
goal of the development is A minor and is rounded out by the
statements of first the distinctive cadential pattern of motive
G (mm. 78-81 corresponding to mm. 128-31) and then the closing
motive H (mm. 132-37).
Yet this movement cannot be called
ternary, for new material then ensues, beginning in G minor
and proceeding to the original tonic through its submediant side
(BL major), which also provides a mediant-submediant
tonal
axis with the exposition.
A tonal recapitulation begins with
motive D (m. 169) which corresponds to a second theme. An
extended cadence (mm. 178-191) reaches the deceptive cadence
to the submediant which preceded other statements of motive
H. This motive, followed by a cadence-defining

be expressed in round numbers as 7:10, or in percentages, the
second part is 131% as long as the first.
This movement can be contrasted with four "ternary" sonataform movements in minor, three by Haydn and one by J. B.
Vanhal (the third movement of the Sinfonia in A minor, listed
in the 1772 supplement of the Breitkopf Thematic Catalogue),
in which the recapitulation begins with musical material other
than the first theme in tonic minor.
All of these four movements have true developments,
and in two of them (Haydn,
Symphony No. 80, first movement, and the finale of the Vanhal
sinfonia) the development is longer than the exposition.
The
following table also includes the finale of J. C. Bach's C minor
sonata for purposes of comparison:

plateaux. These tonal axes in minor are also frequently present
in ternary sonata-form movements (the transition
sections,
especially when a well-defined theme is also present as in the
first movement of Mozart's G minor symphony, K. 550, are a
favorite location internary forms), since these axes are necessary to compensate for the inherent relative instability of the
minor mode.
(6) Statement of any thematic material belonging properly to
the first theme-group immediately before the "tonal recapitulation", whether in the home key (J. C. Bach, sinfonia in G
minor Op. 6 No. 6, third movement, mm. 57-60 corresponding
to mm. 4-5 of the exposition) or the subdominant (J. A. Benda,
sonata in C minor, first movement, mm. 45-49 corresponding
with mm. 1-3 and 29-31 and forming a grand iv-V cadence)*24,
vitiates the binary character implied hitherto in the movement
and creates in retrospect the impression
of an essentially
ternary form even though the first theme in its original form
and tonic is not restated.
The tonal recapitulation must begin
with material associated with the second theme or its equivalent, and must not be immediately preceded by first-theme
material.
(7) The binary sonata form movement fell into disuse first as
an opening movement, next as a finale, and survived longest
as a slow movement but was replaced here by the abridged
sonata form. Yet many of its characteristics,
especially the
beginning of the tonal recapitulation with the second theme,
were subsequently to be encountered in several sonata-form
movements by, among others, Chopin and Brahms.

The principal discussion of this topic is by Ralph Kirkpatrick in his Domenico
Scarlatti (Reprint: New York, 1968), pp. 251-79. He deals with tonal rather than
withthematic-motivic
relationships and his subject is a stylistically earlier type
of sonata than those investigated in this study.

12 Rutini's Op. 5 No. 5 sonata(Musiche vocale e strumentali sacre e profane XXXIII)
(Rome, 1967) is an excellent example. The first movement is hierarchically and
clearly organized whereas the second consists of motivic complexes in which the
second section begins like a development with the opening two motives in major
(albeit tonic major) after which material ensues which corresponds to a second
theme-group in the mediant, and the third section is a compressed recapitulation
of both preceding sections in tonic minor.

the reverse, occurs in Electra's aria in Act I of Mozart's Idomeneo, an aria in
a quite unusual binary form. The section stated originally in the mediant (F
major, mm. 48-73) contains surprising uses of F minor (mm. 53-54, 67-68, for
example) which are strikingly mirrored with tonic major in the reprise of this
section in the home key of D minor (m. 113, 128-31); many interesting tonal axes
abound in this aria.
