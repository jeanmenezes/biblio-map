an essay, Das Bearbeitungsverfahren
bei den 11 Praludien im

the Friedemann Bach Clavierbichlein
were arrangements
of
the ones in the Well-Tempered
Clavier, made by Bach himself
to adapt them for the little hands of his son. Among other
things, this argumentation disregards entirely the question of
register which is of paramount importance in judging the relative value of the different versions.
It is not the purpose of this article to go further into the question of Obligatory Register in its broadest aspect as it pertains
to an entire composition.
Our aim is rather to show a number
of instances where register contributes in an essential way to
clarifying certain contrapuntal, structural, or thematic-motivic
connections and relations.

and we will simply proceed from one example to
systematic,
the next.
Before presenting examples in which the bass shows largescale progressions,
we should like to discuss one of the relatively rare cases in which a middle register plays an essential
role. In the middle section of the Adagio of Mozart's Piano
Sonata, K. 576, in D major, the main melody notes are doubtless a2, b2, a2 in m. 17, 18, and 19 respectively.
Yet if we
follow up the initial c#2 of m. 17 we hear that it describes a
slow turn-like motion c#2-d2-c#2-b#2-c#2
during these measures. In Example la (p. 58) these notes are connected by heavy
lines between the staves.
Since c#2 is also the very first tone
of the Adagio and since it reappears in m. 5 and in m. 13 we
understand the c#2 of m. 17 simply as another occurrence.
Of course there is nothing remarkable about a middle section

instances of this are to be found, for example, in Chopin's
Mazurkas Op. 24/4 or Op. 30/1, taken at random. What gives
the c#2 in our Mozart excerpt such significance is the fact that
both in m. 1 and in m. 17 it is followed by a turn, the second

ing and linking the F# minor part closely to the beginning. The
point we want to make here is that despite the motivic relationship of the turn which can easily be seen on paper, this

of reg-

Further, Example la (p. 58) shows that in m. 23 the turn starts
on d2 (note the suspension of d2 onthe thirdbeat which corresponds to the suspension of c#2 in m. 191) and that it "comes
out into the open" in 32nd notes at m. 24. Example lb (p. 58)
shows that the entire middle section is governed by the same
turn, with b#-c# appearing an octave lower, for pianistic
reasons.
Significantly, Mozart does not write a turn in m. 39
- although it would have been due here - a turn based on f#
instead of c#2 or its auxiliary note d2. However, he makes
amends for this missing turn. At the very last moment before
the return of the main section, he manages to insert c#2-b#2
between the seventh d and its resolution c#2 in the reprise so
that at this point we hear once more the turn motive (Example
lc, p. 58). Since we already are on the V7 chord of A major
and expect the tonic momentarily, the turn with its b# sounds
like a last farewell to the events of the middle section.
In the
subsequent measure it is replaced by the turn with the initial,
normative bt.
Two more instances in which the middle register plays a leading role are to be found in Brahms' Intermezzo, Op. 116/4,
in E major, and in the Scherzo of Beethoven's Sonata, Op. 26,
in Ab major. In the Brahms work, the idea appearing in m. 1
is continued to d#1 at the pianissimo,
3 lines before the end,
and from there to el, 9 measures away.
Beethoven's

Scherzo opens in an unusual way.

Example 2.

Beethoven:

Sonata in Ab major,

Op. 26

Trio

Sf

The top voice outlines the Ab triad but the bass enters on fl,
the auxiliary note of ebl in m. 2. Later this fl-ebl becomes
the first motive of the Trio. Although the F minor triad in
m. 1 is of a merely contrapuntal nature, Beethoven nevertheless begins the reprise (m. 45) as if the piece were
actually
written in F minor, introducing it by a V7 harmony on C which
lasts no less than 21 measures.
Thus, fl, which in m. 1
clashes so sharply withthe tonic triad outlined bythe top voice
(see the sforzato), determines the entire course of the compo-

can understand the beginning of the Trio as a reiteration of m.
1-2 of the Scherzo.
It is as if fl at last comes into its own
when it becomes the third in Db major. In passing, it should
be mentioned that fl-ebl
played a certain role even in the
first movement, especially in the middle section of the theme
and at the beginning of the last variation.
As an example of bass progressions
which are made to stand
out by means of low register we cite m. 52-124 in the first
movement of Bach's Italian Concerto.

It is noteworthy that Bach's keyboard extended as Lar as the
low A (see the Finale); thus he could have written B and A in
m. 60 and in m. 74 an octave lower, had he so desired.
Yet
he reserved this register for the main structural tones C-DBb-C, of which C-Bb-A is only a prolongational motion.
Bass progressions
brought into prominence in a manner similar to that described above occur fairly frequently.
For example, in Chopin's Etude, Op. 10/8, in F major, the bass
line D-C-Bb-A (m. 29-41) stands out because of the register.
Domenico Scarlatti was particularly ingenious in using the extreme registers - especially the low bass - very sparingly,
and chiefly at the main structural points. Examples ofthis as
well as examples of the use of register for other purposes can
be found in abundance in his Sonatas. When one examines the
Sonatas for features of this kind one gradually comes to realize
that the beauty of Scarlatti's keyboard style -and that of other
composers too - is at least partly due to masterly treatment
of register.
Turning now to registral features of the top voice, we should
first like to mention Beethoven's Bagatelle, Op. 119/1, in G
minor, and its coda in particular. A coda was probably necessary in this piece, perhaps because it needed a stronger ending after the almost literal repetition of the first section.
But
what would be the tonal content of the coda? The Eb major
middle section starts out from gl, gradually works its way up
to g2, then ends as shown inExample 4, with c3 and bb2 super-

of a long ascent, c3 and bb2 are reached again.
This time
they are led down stepwise to g2, in a stronger, more definite
fashion and supported by cadential bass steps. Thus, here the
high register which was only briefly suggested previously is
restated, and that which was lacking in the middle section is
But although the two points in question, the
finally fulfilled.
one in the middle section and the other in the coda, have been
associated by means of register,
they are not structurally
connected. The c3 and the passage that follows in the coda are
merely a repetition of something we have heard before, the
repetition of a musical idea even though its meaning is changed.
Thus the association
is necessarily
loose and was possible
only in a composition as simple in character as this Bagatelle.
In contrast to the situation described above, the registral connection between m. 17 and m. 20 of Bach's Chromatic Phantasy is very close.

If we eliminate the arpeggiations
and two subsidiary chords,
we reveal the auxiliary note motion, 9-8, over A.
This is
perhaps so obvious that one need not call special attention to
it. However, we wish to emphasize that the principle is exactly the same whether we deal with a group of 4 measures or
with connections over much larger spans such as those to be
examined below: register

tween this type of piano style, with the high register appearing
at only a few strategic points, and that of Scarlatti.
Through
the ages the external appearance of music had changed immensely, of course, but the principle of writing for keyboard
instruments remained the same.
The Menuetto of Schubert's Quartet in A minor, specifically
its recapitulation,
is probably unique in the entire literature
(Example 7a, p. 58). Upon arriving at the V7 chord in m. 35,
there is a sudden halt, followed by a recapitulation based on
C# minor instead of in the expected A minor, with the register
dropping a full octave. (Actually, C# on which the recapitulation begins is merely a connective between E and A# which
lies within a prolongation of the dominant extending from m.
35 to m. 55.) Furthermore,
the motives shown in Example 7b
(p. 58) are also continued at this point and the previous forte
is resumed.
All these factors contribute to the linking of m.
35 with m. 56, but probably the most obvious factor involved
is the abandonment ana resumption of the high register at m.
35 and at m. 56, respectively.
The beginning of the recapitulation is interpolated between these two points. It is subordinate to larger events of a higher order, or, to use an image,

However, its importance is minimized by the other

found occasionally
in the works of the great masters.
Wherever it occurs, it constitutes
one of the most remarkable
features of the particular composition.
In the Brahms Capriccio in D minor (Example 6, p. 62) the
return of the first section in m. 62 is inserted or interpolated
in a manner similar to that described above. And in the Rondo
of Mozart's Violin Sonata, K. 526, in A major, the tenth alc#3 in m. 183 (note the beautiful slur ) is derived from and
continues the diminished fifth g#l-d3 outlined in the ending of
the previous E major section (m. 161-164).
Example 8.

K. 526.

183

Thus the intervening recurrence of the main rondo theme in
the lower register sounds incidental to this large-scale
linkage
of the E major section with the one starting at m. 183. Here
again we have a link that is perceivable only through the abandonment and resumption of the three-line
octave.
It should
perhaps be mentioned that, of course, the diminished fifth has
resolved to a-c# in the A major section of m. 167 - but in
the lower octave. As far as register is concerned - and this
is what matters here - d3 is continued to its tone of resolution only in m. 183.
After having followed the previous examples, a longer passage
from the Finale of Mendelssohn's
Quartet in E minor will be
easily understood (Example 9a, p. 65). Measures 288-331 all
lie within the one-line octave.
In m. 332, the e2 of m. 287
continues to d#2. It is preceded by e2 which joins together the
two separated measures.
Thus the half note e represents
a
huge suspension spanning 45 measures (Example 9b, p. 65).
And 5 measures later when d#2 returns to e2, the notes marked
by a bracket show a slightly changed enlargement of the motive
appearing in m. 286-287, the point at which the high register
was interrupted.
Thus these two distant points are closely
linked together, primarily by means of register, and, in addition, by contrapuntal means (suspension) and motivic relation.

64
of the kind described

used by
By-passing
Bach even in fugue writing.
Measures 6 - 8 of the Fugue in
C minor from Book 2 of the Well-Tempered
Clavier which we
quote in Example 1Oa (p. 65) are of particular interest in this
regard. According to Schenker, in Der Tonwille, Heft 3, p. 43,
published in Vienna, 1923, Beethoven made a copy of this
Fugue for himself and marked the B in m. 7 with a large
cross. Schenker remarks that this B contains a most significant clue to organic fugue writing and that at the same time it
points up an essential difference between the fugal art of Bach
and the fugue writing of others.
We quote:

Thus far Schenker.
A detailed analysis of the fourth entrance
and its immediate
surroundings reveals this passage to be
even more remarkable.
Example lOb (p. 65) shows the main

voice-leading
progressions,
registers in which they actually appear and with a few implied
notes in parentheses;
Example lOc (p. 65) presents a further
reduction with the various registers disregarded.
It becomes
apparent that up to and including the second beat of m. 8 we
hear a progression
of parallel tenths between bass and top
voice.
Consequently, the beginning of the fourth subject entrance (m. 7) occurs at the second tenth eb-g which is merely
passing through. We even have to hear an E" triad at the beAs to the top voice, the discontinuginning of this measure.
ation of the high register
and its resumption
in m. 8 show
clearly that the first tenth f-ab2 finds its real continuation only
with E -g2 on the third beat of m. 8, well after the fifth entrance has begun.
The true goal of the over-all
motion is
therefore the C minor sixth chord in m. 8, not the C minor
triad in m. 7. Because of this the fourth entrance is weakened
in three different ways: the B deprives it of the G minor
quality, the key in which it should have appeared; it is merely
inserted between several passing tenths; and the registral
connection of the top voice makes it sound almost parenthetical. We wait for the continuation of ab2, and when g2 finally
appears as its continuation, the fourth entrance is a thing of
the past. This passage is a striking example of Bach's art
of subordinating fugal entrances to the broader scheme of the

composition and to make them an integral part of the whole.
To achieve this end, he often made the entrances so inconspicuous that they pass by almost unnoticed. A good example
of this is the entrance in m. 11 of the same fugue, although
Bach uses means other than registral to achieve this. Other
instances of Bach's use of register can be found in the Fugue
in C# major, from Book 1 of the Well-Tempered
Clavier, m.
13-16 and in the big Organ Fugue (BWV 547) in C major which
is altogether a miracle of this type of fugue writing.
One is
reminded of Robert Schumann's somewhat facetious remark:
The best fugue will always be that which the public takes for

I know of -

-

a con-

noisseur of music, by no means contemptible, who mistook a Bach
Fugue for a Chopin Etude - to the honor of both.
As additional examples, we refer the reader to m. 21-41 of
the first movement of Mozart's Piano Sonata in C minor, where
the first part of the Eb major section is "bridged over"' We
also suggest m. 14-23-27 of the first movement of Mozart's
Quartet in D minor, which are somewhat similarly constructed,
or m. 83-108-120-132
of Schubert's Wanderer Phantasy, where
the beginning of the. Eb major theme is inserted between ab3
and ab3-g3 in m. 108 and in m. 120. Lack of space makes it
impossible to go into detailed analyses of these compositions.
They would reveal beautiful motivic and other relationships
and connections besides the ones expressed solely by register.
A few more interesting examples can also be found in Jonas'
book, published in Vienna, 1934, Das Wesen des musikalischen Kunstwerks, Ex. 116,118, 119, 194; and in Schenker's
Der freie Satz, Ex. 40,7; 62,3; 62,4; 101,6.
One might well ask why in the course of this discussion no examples from orchestral compositions
were cited. The reply
is that in orchestral compositions
register plays a less significant role in pointing out or providing large-scale
connections, than it does in keyboard compositions.
The reason may
be that the orchestra, with such a great variety of means at
its disposal, does not require the use of register to the same
extent as the more poorly endowed keyboard instrument.
A
similar reason may account forthe lack of examples from such
an outstanding composer as Chopin. His richly developed
piano style apparently found new techniques of writing which
probably replaced older ones. Besides, one may say that from
the very beginning of any of his major compositions all the
of the keyboard are simultaneously
registers
present, as it

67
were. Even so, register connections and relations are to be
found in his compositions.
In many cases, however, they are
not quite as clear-cut as the ones in earlier piano music and
were therefore not as suitable for the first presentation of the
subject.
As the last example to be presented we have chosen the first
movement of Beethoven's
Piano Sonata, Op. 13, in C minor,
the Sonate Pathetique.
this movement extends in
Clearly,
various ways far beyond anything the young Beethoven or anyone else had written before. One of the most striking features
of this magnificent piece of music is the reappearance of a
part of the introduction at the beginning of the development
section, and again at the beginning of the short coda. A similar
use of the introduction within the Allegro section is to be found
in Haydn's Symphony in Eb major, No. 103, which Beethoven
probably knew at the time he wrote his Sonata in C minor.
Beethoven had employed a similar procedure once before: in
the Kurfirsten Sonata in F minor, written at the age of 12, he
introduced the recapitulation by a free repetition of the initial
In Op. 13, his intention was different: to make
introduction.
the introduction an integral part of the entire first movement.
The combination of elements of the first subject and of the introduction at the beginning of the Allegro in the development
(m. 137-141) serves the same purpose.
Also the melodic reof the introduction and
lationship between certain elements
certain passages of the Allegro is quite apparent and has been
described repeatedly.
Thus as far as thematic material is
concerned the composition is a unified whole.
When we turn to an examination of the structure of the exposition, we will first of all have to clarify the harmonic and contrapuntal meaning of m. 51-88.
There can be no doubt that
this section is to be considered the second subject.
This is
because when we arrive at Eb major, III of C minor, (m. 89)
we have the impression of already being at the beginning of the
coda of the exposition.
This impression
is created mainly by
the fact that the ascending chromatic line of m. 89-98 bears a
resemblance
to the first subject.
The resemblance becomes
still closer in the analogous place in the recapitulation
(at
m. 253).
It is surprising that even Tovey considers the second
subject
to be written "in Eb minor." By no means can the six-four
chord at its beginning be considered
an inversion of an Eb
minor triad. Nor is there any Eb minor triad or sixth chord
to be found, except for one in m. 79. This, however, is
merely

a passing harmony between Db and F in m. 75 and in m. 83.
The second subject should be understood as taking place within
an extended prolongation of the Bb harmony, the dominant of
III which finally enters at m. 89.

The bass, represented in Example lla, shows an arpeggiation
of the Bb minor instead of the Bb major harmony, the minor
third Db appearing in m. 75. Thus it becomes evident that the
initial "Eb minor" six-four chord has nothing to do with Eb
minor; rather, it is related to the Db chord arising in m. 75,
and this in turn is part of the larger Bb minor harmony. The
gbl is an auxiliary note of fl in m. 43 and serves as consonant
preparation of the seventh gb in m. 64. It then returns to f as
shown in Example lla.
This makes it clear that the first Eb
harmony is reached only after the second subject has passed
by: in m. 89, at the beginning of the coda of the exposition.
Instead of bringing in the second subject on m, which is the
normal procedure, Beethoven starts it on Bb, that is, during
the motion towards Eb. The purpose of this overlap of structural and thematic events is to achieve a tighter connection
between the different sections.
In an earlier work, Sonata,
Op. 2/1, in F minor, Beethoven had based the second subject
on the dominant of III. However, the prolongation of that
dominant was simpler and briefer than the instance in Op. 13.
in this remarkable
Turning now to the function of register
treatment of theme and harmonic progression, we see with the
aid of Example llb, that the main bass progression
from the
beginning of the exposition to the beginning of the coda consists
of C-Bb-Eb.

could hardly be imagined.
In addition it must be remarked that the rising third c-d-eb
represents more than just the lower third of the C minor triad:
it is thematic in character, constituting a huge enlargement of
the same third in m. 1 of the introduction.
The introduction
itself shows a first enlargement of this third, with the same
bass as later in the Allegro, in the one-line octave in m. 1, 4
(end), and 5. This enlargement then prepares the ground, so
to speak, for the second and most extended enlargement in the
exposition.
In the recapitulation,
it was not possible for Beethoven to duplicate the effect he had created with his treatment of the
second subject in the exposition.

harmony in the exposition, he begins the second subject on the
F minor six-four chord, the subdominant (m. 221), which then
leads to V and to I. This six-four chord is, for once, a true
inversion since it is followed by the F minor sixth chord.

found a "substitute solution;' one which is as impressive
as
his use of register in the exposition. We fSid that the development section concludes in m. 187 with a V chord. The resolution of the seventh f3 to eb3 seems not to be forthcoming.
The recapitulation begins, the entire first subject passes by,
still no eb3. The second subject begins on the subdominant,
as described above; then in m. 231-232 the melody leaps, unexpectedly and strikingly, to f3. This f3 takes up the precedf3 of the development; it becomes a seventh

In the Menuetto of his Quartet in A minor,
Schubert carried out the same idea but by different means, as
previously discussed and illustrated in Example 8 (p. 63).

Example 12a shows Beethoven's general plan (an octave lower)
and explains also why the six-four chord in m. 239 must be
considered a tonic six-four, not an embellishing chord of any
kind.

Example 12b includes f3 of the second subject.
This note
appears first as a consonant sixth whichprepares and reintroduces the seventh f3. One can hardly consider it as structurally, contrapuntally connected back to f3 of the development.
Rather, f3 forms what one might describe as a prefix to eb3.
It is associative in character, reiterating f3 of m. 187 for the
purpose of underscoring the large progression f3 - eb3.
In a looser way even the introduction of Op. 13 is connected to
the Allegro by means of the high register.
Its climax is also
a V7 chord with f3. This f3 does continue to an eb3, but since
eb3 appears in a six-four chord on the dominant, it is a passing tone moving on to d2 in the next measure, not a true resolution. In the strictest sense, then, f3 resolves in the threeline octave only at m. 98, towards the end of the exposition.
This huge arch subordinates the first and second subjects of
the exposition, just as f3 of the development section moves to
eb3 of the second subject and bridges everything in between.

But even if we wanted to attach more importance to eb3 in
m. 10 - it certainly gives more definition to the ending of the
introduction than is found at the end of the development section
--the fact would remain that the three-line octave is abandoned
at this point, that no d3 as the tone of resolution appears, and
that eb3 is taken up only in m. 98. Consequently, the picture
drawn in Example 13 would not be essentially altered.
Corroborating our reading is the striking resemblance of m. 9 - 11
to m. 187 - 195, with passages rushing down to the beginning
of the first subject.
One can safely say that the grandiose use of the high register
for creating large-scale
connections
and for tying various
sections closely together constitutes one of the main features
of this movement.
