In this section we define the notion of a region. Regions will be constructedby employing two properties,connectedness and complementarity,definedin the set P.As we will see, these propertieshave some historical sanction.We have chosen them for theirefficacy,however,not in
an overt attemptat historicalreconstruction.
Definition1: Let S be a subset of P and let pe P. S is a connectedsubset of P if, wheneverSa<p<Sb where sa and SbES, it is truethatpc S. The
connectedsubsetsof P may be regardedsimply as uninterrupted
sections
of the sequence of P numbers-for example, {8,9,12 }.
It appearsthatthe propertyof connectednessin P was a desirableone
for some of the ancient authorities.Timaios of Locri, for example, presents a long series of connectedP numbersbeginningwith 384, or Cg,the
point at which the diatonic scale first appearsin the sequence of P numbers (Tobin 1985, 43). In Scolica enchiriadisitself, the one time the scale
is associated with numbersit begins as a connected set from C7, or 192
(Schmid 1981, 145). This yields the notes of one octave of the diatonic
scale, except thatthe note B cannotbe representedas an integer.
Elementsthatare adjacentin the orderedsequence will be called connected elements.For example, 9 and 12 are connectedelements in P. Of
special importancewill be connectedpurepowers of 2 and 3, which will
be representedby 2Aand 3B.For example 8 and 9, or 23 and 32 are con117

premise that 2A and 3B are connected. Since A-1 and B-1 play roles in
the construction,we requirethatA and B be positive integers.The first

stage, one
octave of the scale is associatedwith numbersbeginning,as we observed
above, an octave too low to find a complete scale in whole numbers.
Even more tantalizingis the remarkby the anonymousauthorof De

surely recognized that the letter C, which the ancients consideredto be

pentatonic,and diatoniccould be realized as connected subsets of Pythagoreannumbersbeginning on 6, 48,

found intriguing(as do we) the remark theDe modorumanonymous.10

just aboutreachedthe limit of the usefulness of our ad hoc approachto
the determinationof regions, since the numbers are becoming rather
large. In this case 219and 312are connected in P, and their ratio corresponds to the Pythagoreancomma. In turn, the intervalsbetween adjacent elements within this region are the diatonic and chromatic half1
steps, limmaand apotome.
121

Following this is the region R(27,17),which containsthe division of the
octave in 17 parts,describedby the Arabic theoristAl-Farabiin the late
ninth or early tenth century(Sachs 1943, 278-80). The 17-note system
also plays a role in Renaissancetheoriesof chromaticism,discussed, for
example, in the Libellus monochordiof Prosdocimo de' Beldomandi
containsa 53-note
(Herlinger1987, 139-47). Yet anotherregion,R(84,53),

What is perhapsmost strikingaboutthe regions we have constructed
is thatthey containvariousnotablescales, especially the pentatonic,diatonic, and chromaticscales. These scales are worthinvestigatingon their
own account-as we will see, they all sharethe propertywe have called
well-formedness.But to identify the scales within regions is to focus on
the pitch classes they contain, and it is worth questioningone's almost
reflexivemove to abstractpitch-classinformationfrom a pitch structure.
Going back to first principles,we recall that regions were defined in
the context of P, which was generatedentirelyby two numbers,2 and 3.
As mathematical
roles
entities,these numbersplay perfectlysymmetrical
in P and in its regions.There is no reasonto assign a privilegedstatusto
either of them, prior to interpretingthem as representingthe intervals
octave and twelfth. Even when that interpretation made, there is no
is
to favor the octave over the twelfth by imposing octave equivnecessity
alence. The intervalsplay symmetricalroles in the constructionof regions, and either (or neither)may be chosen as a modularframe.Within
the region, the intervalsremainin a kind of balance.
To begin to understand natureof this balance,considerthe diatonic
the
region R( 1,7). The region allows for 10 perfectoctaves from C-c to ee' and 6 perfect twelfths from C-g to A-e'. This space is maximalin
this respect, as figure 8 shows. Either interval is extended outside the
region only at the expense of the other.
Anotherlesson to be drawnis thatthereis nothingin the formalconstructionthatrequiresthat the generatingnumbersbe 2 and 3. Certainly
a medievalmusicianwould only deal with integers,in particular powthe
ers of 2 and 3, but if one thinks carefully about the definitions,there is
that prenothing in the notions of connectednessand complementarity
cludes the generatingnumbersfrombeing rationalor even irrational.
Retonal spaces.
gions are not necessarilydefinedonly in Pythagorean
If we constructP* from the values 2 and 3/2 representing,respectively, the octave and perfect fifth, the regions in P* appearto be truncated versions of the regions in P. The beginning of the sequence of P*
elements is shown below, together with the sequence of orderedpairs

Forexample,the diatonicregiongeneratedby octaves and fifthscould be
represented by the notes C2 to E3. Since 24 and (23) are the connected elements that determine this region, we refer to it as R(4,7) in P*. There are

7+4-1=10 elements in this region, and it representsthe largestdiatonic
spanin which octaves and fifths may be maintained.12As we have stated,
the generating intervals themselves are balanced in the region so that
eitherone (or neither)may be chosen as the intervalestablishinga modularequivalencerelation.
This brings us to a reconsideration what is surely the most notoriof
ous aspect of the Enchiriadis treatises: the dasian notation and the
strangescale associatedwith it, firstelucidatedby Spitta(1889). As figure 9 shows, this scale comprises a series of four disjunctDorian tetrachords,plus two residualor remnantnotes. Althoughthe emphasisin the
treatises is on the Dorian tetrachord,with its tone-semitone-tonesymmetry,the dasian scale can also be regardedas a series of identicalconjunct pentachords,that is, periodic at the fifth.13
Such a scale lends itself ideally to organumat the fifth. In organum

allows two voices to move perpetuallyin paralleloctaves, while voices

scale the reverse is the case: parallelfifths may be maintainedperpetually, while motion in parallel octaves will eventually result in an augmented octave. See figure 10. Within the region, where the dasian and

plished simultaneouslywith the establishmentof the gamut and a suitable notation.One of the featuresof the diatonicsystem thatwas evident
to those engaged in these tasks was that similartonal patternsexisted in
the neighborhoodsof pitches a fifth or a fourthapart.Thus, four finalsD,E,F,G-sufficed to classify chants according to their endings.'5 Put
anotherway, given the system of four maneriae, each embracingtwo
modes, some chants(or portionsof them) mightbe placed equally well a
fifth (more rarely,a fourth)above one of the finals.16
This observationof similaritydevelopedinto the doctrineof the affinities.'7 The radical approachof the Enchiriadis treatises was to make
affinity at the fifth perfect by treatingthe tetrachordof the finals as a
modularunit, with the fifth as intervalof periodicity.The choice of the
fifthrather
thanthe octaveyielded a moremanageablebasic unit,for both
the voice and the mind.'8 Position finding, that is, determiningmodal
identity,thusbecame a functionof the placementof a single semitone.As
Phillips (1984, 161) points out, in Scolica enchiriadis the semitone is
considered to be the heart and soul of melody: "cor atque animus...
cantilenae."
Theoristsof the eleventh centuryrejectedthe dasian scale: Guido of
Arezzo (implicitly) and HermannusContractus(explicitly) were both
critical.19
Thus Guido: "Likenessis not complete except at the octave."
Handschin,however,emphasizes that Guido, despite his critical stance,
was trulya follower of the Enchiriadistraditionin the great attentionhe
125

paid the affinities(1948, 323). Guido'sproblemwas to reconcile the four
of
basic "qualities" the dasiansystem with "the seven differentnotes."20
Guido's principalstatementon the affinities is chapter7 of Micrologus. He describes the modus vocum, or characteristicmotion through
tonal space, thatdeterminesaffinity.The firstmodusvocum,for example,
is "when from a note one descends by a tone and ascends by a tone, a
semitone, and two tones, as from A and D," (Babb 1978, 63); similarly
for the finalsE andF andthe notes a fifth above anda fourthbelow them.
Guido treatedthe final G as an exception, a note withoutan affinity.For
Guido, essentially the same tonal space exists within the sixths bounded
by r and E, and C and a.
Hermannus,
writinga few decadesafterMicrologus,treatedthe affinities in a more logically satisfying (if less practical)way than Guido in
chapter7. His rule:"Take tetrachord wish-say, thatof the graves
any

Therearefour
modes and as many tonal patterns[modivocum]."(Ellinwood 1936, 57.)
Thus his modi vocumagree with Guido's except thatG also has affinities
at the fifth above and fourthbelow, d and D.21His more logical arrangement of the affinitiesis apparentif representedon the diatoniccircle of
fifths thus: F<->C G<->D<-A E<-B. The note D is both protusin the
in
finales and tetrardus the graves. The fifths and fourthsthat are priviconnect tones that have the same position
leged underthis arrangement
withintheirtetrachords are called by Hermannus
and
natural(naturalis);
the others,connectingC to G andA to E are formal(formalis).
If C and G are taken as lower boundaries,and a and e as upper,they
markthe limits of affinity,since C and G are only similarin ascent and a
and e are only similarin descent. The boundarypitches within both theorists' conceptions are those of the naturaland hardhexachords,as they
were latercalled. While neitherused the term,the hexachordis described
by Hermannus'srule. As we will see, the hexachordmediates among
what we call the variousdiatonicregions.
Guido gave furtherconsiderationto the affinities in chapter8 of Micrologus, in an accountmore theoreticallyconsistentthanthatof the previous chapter.Here he considersthe generalaffinityof all notes a fifth or
a fourthapart.

This is the diatonicregion generatedby octaves and fourths.This region is the maximal space in which perfect octaves and fourthsmay be
maintained;that is, it is the maximal space within which octave equivalence and fourth equivalence are equally valid. Taking the fourth as a

is
consistent with Guido's text, which asserts that three notes-C, D, Ecapturethe possible tonal characters.

The diatonicregiongeneratedby octaves andfourthsis closely related
to the correspondingoctave-eleventhregion. This region coincides with
the gamutof Pseudo-Odo(leavingout the alternate
ninthstep, the soft b),
spanningtwo octaves and a tone, from F to aa. The eleventhsreflectthe
combinedrangesof authenticand plagal modes, as displayedin the treatises of first Aribo (Smits van Waesberghe1951, 18-20), then John of

Some of the tonal spaces we have been discussing arise in two examples by J. S. Bach. In example 1, the subject and answer from the CClavier,Bach uses the
MajorFugue from Book I of the Well-Tempered
maximumdiatonicspace thatpermitsa realanswer.The notes of the subject are all of the notes of the naturalhexachord,while those of the real
answercomprisethe hardhexachord,at the fifth above. Thus, the entire
space of subjectand answeris the diatonicregion determinedby octave
and fifth. This is a common enough procedurein fugue, with several
more examples to be found in WTC alone. Here, the structureof the
hexachordregion itself is revealed by the shape of the subject, which
emphasizesthe threeperfectfourthswithin the hexachord.
The second example involves the octave-fourthregion, and is taken
from the C-MajorInvention.Bach has made use of the largestdiatonic
span in which both the octave frameand fourthframemay be preserved
(example2). The sequencebeginningin m. 3 presentsthe threedifferent
species of filled-in descending perfect fourths:half-step on the bottom,
on top, and in the middle, designatedby a, b, and c, respectively.Considering the potential role of the fourth in this region, the modulation
takes on a new significance. The descending perfect fourth usurps the
octave as interval of periodicity, through sequence gaining inertial or
conservative force to preserve its frame past the confines of C major.
Once all of the species of fourthshave been exhausted,the patternbegins
again.

Regions are tonal spaces generatedby two coequal intervals.The perspective shifts from the bounded space of regions to the infinitely extendible space of scales, if the intervalsare assigned fundamentally
dissimilarroles. One intervalis chosen as the modularframe,and the other
intervalbecomes the now single generatorof the notes of the scale. The
scales that arise in this way are well-formed.
Definition: A well-formed scale is generated by a single interval,
where the generatingintervalis spannedby a constant numberof step
intervals(see p. 139).
In the particular
case of the diatonicset, the perfectfifth generatesthe

steps, to wit, 4. Also, as figure 16a makes clear,diatonicsteps are always
the sum of two fifths (modulo the octave). These two statements are
equivalent.
Intervalsmay be measuredgenerically or specifically.Generic measure counts the numberof scale steps thatthe intervalspans. In the context of well-formed scales, specific measure is expressed as an integer
multiple of the generatinginterval-the formal fifth-reduced modulo
the formaloctave. For example, in the usual diatonicset, 4 fifths modulo
the octave is the majorthird,and -3 fifths is the minorthird.
The musical significance of well-formednessis principallythis: in a
well-formedset, the intervaldetermined n formalfifthsalways retains
by
its generic identity,no matterwhere in the set it may be located. In particular,this means that if n formal fifths is a step intervalsomewherein
the set, it is always a step, nevera skip. Contrastthis with the situationin
the hexachord,considerednow as a scale ratherthan as a region. It has
some of the characteristics the diatonic set. It is generatedby perfect
of
fifths, and it is a deep scale (as defined in Gamer(1967)), but it is not a
well-formedscale. In the scale C D E F G A (C), the minorthird(-3 fifths)
is sometimes a step (at A to C) and sometimes a skip (at D to F and E to
G). This distinctionwas drawnby Dahlhaus(1990, 172): "Thepentatonic
andheptatonicscales aresystems.In comparison,the hexachordis a mere
auxiliary construction.As a system it would be self-contradictory...
would... lead to the absurdconsequence that the listener would have
to alternate
betweenthe idea of the minorthirdas a 'step'andas a 'leap.'"
In figure 16b, the lack of well-formedness in the hexachordis shown
134

as a failure of symmetrypreservation, opposed to the case of the diaas
tonic set.
Anotherimportantpropertyof well-formed sets is a consequence of
this coordinationof generic and specific intervals.All non-trivialwellformed scales have Myhill's Property(MP), identified by Clough and
Myerson (1985). A set has MP if every non-zero generic intervalcomes
in two specific varieties.For example, in the usual diatonic, 2nds, 3rds,
4ths and so on come in two sizes. If MP is definedappropriately is actuit
ally equivalentto well-formedness.27
We have seen how to generate,in principle,all regions. Each pair of
intervalsgives rise to a P-type space and to a hierarchyof regions. We
have assertedthateach region determinestwo essentially differentwellformed scales, with the two intervals exchanging the roles of formal
octave and formal fifth. We have also assertedthat from a well-formed
scale (given its formalfifth andformaloctave) one can recoverits region.
But how do we know that this correspondenceholds? PartVI develops
the mathematical
theoryof regions, and revealsthe relationshipbetween
regions and well-formedscales.

The mathematicsrequiredto develop a theory of regions depends
upon whathas been called the most enduringproblemof numbertheory:
that of diophantineequations, which the Greek mathematicianswere
adept at solving. Figure 17 demonstratesthe applicationof linear dioThe fact that there are always

has solutions, butAy+Bx=z in ordinaryarithmeticdoes not always have
solutions in non-negativeintegers x and y. If a given z does have such
solutions we will say that z is solvable. In the set ZAB={0, 1, . . . AB-1 },

the last A+B-l consecutiveintegersare solvable.As figure 17 shows, for
all of the values from 8 to 14, the equation5y+3x=z has solutionsin nonnegative numbersx and y. The solvable elements 8 to 14 map onto the

We are now in a position to give a proof of what we will call the theorem of Lucas (1891, 3:480-83). We give our own proof, because it affords more insight into the questionat handthandoes thatby Lucas.

as

Looking back at the proof of the theorem,evidently half of the elements of ZAB
from 0 to AB-(A+B) are solvable, and their complements
are not. Furthermore, and only if, an element and its complementare
if,
both solvable, they both belong to the abstract region in ZABfrom
AB-(A+B)+ 1 to AB-1. It will turnout thatT mapsthis set onto the region
R(A,B).

Recalling our definitionof a set of complements,we can see thatboth
of the subsets 0, 1, ... AB-(A+B)} and {AB-(A+B)+1, ... AB-1 } are
sets of complementsin ZAB.
Also, both subsetsare connected,if we carry
over the definition of connectednessto ZAB consider elements 0 to
and
AB-1 to be orderedas ordinary
integers.However,the abstract
regionhas
the additionalpropertythat all of its elements are solvable. Thus it will
turnout thatthe region,the largestconnectedset of complementsin G(A,B),
correspondsto the largestconnectedset of solvable complementsin ZAB.
To carry this projectout and to evaluate the region requiresthat the
solutions (x,y) e ZAx ZBto the congruencesz _ Ay+Bx be determined.
Then it must be shown that if the mapping(x,y) -> Ay+Bx is increasing
(as we know it is on the abstractregion), so is the mapping(x,y) -> vXgY.
Both these determinations
dependupon the propertiesof continuedfractions, and we omit the details. It is not difficult to show that the values
(ak(-l)k(n-B))modA and (bk(-1)k(A-n))modB, where ak/bkis the penultimate

convergentin the continued fraction representingA/B, are solutions x
and y, respectively, in non-negative integers to the equation Ay+Bx=
AB-(A+B)+n for n from 1 to A+B-1. Again omitting the details, if and
only if vA and gB are connected, then A/B belongs to the series of rational approximations the numberlogvg generatedby its continuedfracof

The above formula tells us that the region is an orderedset: its elements increaseas n increase,from 1 to A+B-1. Hence there areA+B-1
elements in the region. The derivationof well-formed scales from this
space is achieved by first treatingone of the generatorsas the formal
octave. Withoutloss of generality,we assume thatv is the formaloctave

pitch classes in the order in which they are generated.As one is only
interestedin pitch class in this context, it makes sense to disregardthe
exponentson v and let those on gt "hopdown,"yielding the set of pitch
classes {O, 1,... B-l). We know that for n ranging from 1 to A+B-1,
elements of the form (bk(-l)k(A-n))modB are pitch classes in scale order.
Let n range from A to A+B-1. Then the value (A-n) ranges from 0 to
B-1. Resetting this expression to n, the mapping n->[bk(-l)kn]modB ar-

rangesthe pitch classes of the scale in order.3'

Thus the inverse mapping n-->[bk-(-1)kn]modB returns pitch classes

from scale orderto formal fifths order;that is, to the orderin which the
pitch classes are generated.It follows that every formal fifth is spanned
by [bk-l(-l)k]modB scale steps. This recaptures the definition of well-

formed scales which was given on p. 133.
Each pair,v and gtas defined, gives rise to a distincthierarchyof regions, ruled by the continuedfractionof logvgt.Each pair also gives rise
to a hierarchyof well-formed scales in which v is taken as the equivalence relationand .tdeterminespitch classes. Assuming t'>ug, spaces

VII
The theory of regions provides a perspectivefrom which to consider
various issues in medieval theory. It prompts a reconsiderationof the
often-discussedrelationshipsamong tetrachords,
hexachords,and gamuts. As we have seen, many of the tonal spaces employed by medieval
139

theoristsare regions, which have a structure
nicely suitedto a numberof
concerns.While thereis no evidence thatwritersof the ninthto eleventh
centuriespossessed the generalnotion of a region, they were bettersituated in some respects than we are today to intuit the importanceof the
variousdiatonicregions.Ourtwentieth-century

features of the system. For example, the notion of
affinity has lost its significance for us: if we want the same tonal environmentarounda differentnote, we simply transpose.The writersof the
early medieval treatises were sensitive to the affinities in part because
they were inclined to treatpitch class, as we call it today,more flexibly.
Depending upon the theoreticalcontext, medieval authorsmight invoke
variousintervalsof periodicityandconsequentnotionsof pitchclass. For
example they might employ the usual seven letter names, A-G; or the
four dasian qualities, Archoos, Deuteros, Tritos, Tetrardos; even the
or
threesyllables, ut, re, mi; or they mightchoose not to considerpitchclass
at all, as in some of the alphabeticgamuts (e.g., A-P) found in Boethius
and in the Enchiriadistreatises.
In practicalterms, the problemof maintainingthe perfectionof two
intervals simultaneouslyin parallel organum is solved within the allembracingsymmetryof the region.The finitudeof regionswas congenial
to the medieval mind as well, consistent with the notions of gamut and
ambitus.The identificationof the Limitedwith orderlinessand the Good
has a philosophicalbasis in a tradition leads fromPythagoras

conjectured.32
Regions and scales are fundamentallydifferent in conception. One
thinks of scales as being, at least potentially,infinitely repeatingin unboundedpitch space; hence the informationthey bear may be encapsulated in a set of pitch classes. Regions, on the otherhand,are necessarily
bounded.
Consider,for example, the hexachord,ubiquitousamong the several
diatonic regions we have identified.While its status as a scale is questionable,as a region it is the tonal space in which the perfectionof fourth
and fifth is maintained.Dahlhaus astutely pointed out its failure as a
scale, but while Dahlhaus, Handschinand others have recognized the
usefulness of hexachords in combination, they have disparagedit, in
Dahlhaus'sterms, as "a mere auxiliaryconstruction." itself, it is more

three species of fourths, as John of Afflighem points out (Babb 1978,

This study has also shed light upon the nature of diatonicism in a

broad sense. Most of the regions that we have discussed have belonged
to a family of diatonicregions.The intervalof the apotomeis the constant

here, acting as the limit for all of them, including the tetrachord the
finals and the hexachord.Those who call the Guidonianhexachordthe
diatonic hexachordare, then, theoreticallyjustified. (The notion of the
apotome itself has been generalized by Regener (1973), Blackwood
(1985), and Careyand Clampitt(1989).)
Everyregioncontainswithinitself two possible ways of spreadingout
into pitch space with one or the other of its generatorschosen to be the
interval of periodicity.The result of either of these choices is a wellformed scale. Just as the hexachords were for Wilhelm of Hirsau the
sedes troporum,the seats of the modes, so are the well-formed scales
enthronedin the regions.

NOTES
1. The diagram and notes on its transmission are found in Schmid (1981, 111).
Musica and Scolica enchiriadis are usually treated as a pair of treatises. Whether
they are by the same author and their relative and absolute chronology are open
questions. Phillips, in her 1984 dissertation, discusses these matters, as well as the
curious titles of these works, and places them in their historical context. Erickson
(1995) is the first translation based on Schmid's edition.
2. The Pythagorean tradition transmitted by Boethius accepted five consonances:
diatessaron (fourth), diapente (fifth), diapason (octave), diapason cum diapente
(twelfth), and disdiapason (double octave). Boethius acknowledged that Ptolemy
accepted six consonances, with the addition of diapason cum diatessaron (eleventh). Boethius's citation of Ptolemy is noted explicitly in Musica enchiriadis
(Schmid 1981, 44). Boethius's contemporary Cassiodorus followed Ptolemy in
the matter of the consonances, with his dictum "Symphoniae autem sex." (Mynors
1937, 145; also Strunk 1950, 89.) Other ninth-century treatises-notably, Musica
disciplina of Aurelian of R66me and De institutione musica of Hucbald-follow
Cassiodorus and use similar language. See Phillips 1990, 108-18, and 1984, chapter 6, especially pp. 240-56.
3. The diagram is found in Steglich's edition (1911, 33). The Quaestiones in musica
is probably from the late eleventh or early twelfth century. It is attributed by
Steglich to Rudolph of St. Trond (1070-1138). Smits van Waesberghe (1949,
98-101), following a suggestion by P. Colestin Vivell, argues that the author was
Franco of Liege (1047-1083?).
4. The choice of pitch class F for the origin is simply for notational convenience. In
this system, new octaves begin on F.

7. A version of R(3.2)
appears in Zarlino's Istitutioni Harmoniche (1558, 17) in a passage concerning musica humana. Although the values are tripled, (to 6, 9, 12, 18),
the accompanying diagram clearly shows the symmetry characteristic of any
region.
8. According to Markovits (1977, 30-31, 44) this is the only scale in early medieval
literature formed according to a monochord division based on C. Hucbald discusses a scale associated with water organs that begins on C. (Babb 1978, 24-25.)
9. "Quoniam autem C litteram, que apud veteres tertia habetur, pro certo comperimus ex numerorum ratione fore primam."(Coussemaker [1867] 1963, 2:85.) De
modorumformulis, treated as a work of Guido of Arezzo by Coussemaker, is listed
as opus dubium by Smits van Waesberghe (1953, 143). Handschin considers it
definitely not by Guido, but by someone closely associated with him (1948, 337).
10. The possibility exists that the author of De modorumformulis is making a reference to a Middle Platonic tradition found in Timaios of Locri and Eudorus (Tobin

and their tetrachordalorganization.
27. See Carey and Clampitt (1989, 202). Strictly speaking, this equivalence holds for
what we called non-degenerate well-formed scales, that is, well-formed scales
with two different step sizes. All equal-interval scales trivially satisfy the definition of well-formedness. These are the degenerate well-formed scales (1989, 200).
See also Chalmers (1975) for a discussion of Moments of Symmetry (MOS), a
class of scales first defined by Ervin Wilson in 1964 in a private communication to
Dr. Chalmers. MOS, MP scales, and well-formed scales are all essentially equivalent concepts.
28. Balzano (1980) appeals to this isomorphism in the special case A=3, B=4 (more
generally, A=k, B=k+ 1) to show how the usual chromatic may be considered to be
the direct product of a diminished seventh chord and an augmented triad. He
remarks that the usual diatonic is a compact region on the lattice corresponding to
this direct product space. This is not a region in our sense, but it is the reflected
image of a chromatic cluster, as Balzano remarks, and the chromatic cluster (more
precisely, the chromatic hexachord) is a region in the space generated by 2"/3and
21/4,equal-tempered major and minor thirds.
29. For more information on continued fractions, see Carey and Clampitt 1989, 197200.
30. The expression t is more general here than the analogous expression in our 1989
article, and v, replacing 2, completely generalizes the notion of formal octave.
