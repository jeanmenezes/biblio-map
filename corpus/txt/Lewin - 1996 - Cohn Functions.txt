COHN FUNCTIONS

David Lewin

is
Ourpoint of departure workdone by RichardCohnin 1993. A symposium on Cohn's ideas was held at SUNY Buffalo on July 28-29,
1993.1This has led to generalizing Cohn's work in a numberof directions. The presentessay is one such generalization.
Part 1: Cohn sets
This section will briefly summarizeCohn's initial observations. Let
us consider the pcset {B,C,D}. If we cast away the pitch class C, and
substitutefor it the adjacent(NB) pitch class C#, we obtain the pcset
{B,C#,D},which is an invertedform of {B,C,D}. I shall say thatwe have
performeda Cohnflip on {B,C,D).
In similar fashion the pcset {C,E,G} can be Cohn-flippedinto its
the
invertedform {C,E6,G},casting out E and substituting adjacent(NB)
pitch class E.
{C,E,G} can also be Cohn-flippedinto its inverted form {B,E,G},
casting out C and substitutingthe adjacent (NB) pitch class B. Thus
{C,E,G} can be Cohn-flippedin two differentways. A pcset with that
propertywill be called a Cohnset.
Cohnlisted all possible Cohn sets in the mod 12 pc universe.They are

(a) the singletons:e.g. {C} Cohn-flipsinto either {B} or {C#}.
(b) the harmonictriads:e.g. {C,E,G} Cohn-flipsas describedabove.
(c) the anhemitonicpentatonicscales: e.g. {C,D,E,G,A} Cohn-flips
into either {C,D,F,G,A} or {B,D,E,G,A}.
(d) the complementsof (a)(b)(c) above-thus includingdiatonic
scale-sets.
(e) and no otherpcsets.
This list is suggestive.Cohndevelopedcertainfindingsandraisedcertain questionsaboutCohn sets, generalizedto universesmod N, whereN
need not be 12. For instance, if we representthe mod 7 universeby a C
in
majorscale, and interpret
"adjacent" a diatoniccontext,then the Cohn
sets are
(a) the singletons:e.g. {C} Cohn-flipsinto either {B } or (the diatonically adjacent){D}.
(b) the fifth-spanning
dyads: e.g. {C,G} Cohn-flipsinto either {C,F}
or {D,G).
(c) the triads:e.g. {C,E,G} Cohn-flipsinto either {B,E,G} or
{C,E,A}.
(d) the complementsof (a)(b)(c) above-thus including seventh
chords.
(e) and no otherpcsets.
This list seems equally suggestive.
Cohn sets characteristically
give rise to Cohn cycles of pcsets. These
are formedby enchainingCohn-flippedsets in the obvious way. Thus, in
the mod 12 world, the C-major-scaleset gives rise to the familiarcycle
of scales through the circle of fifths, i.e.... {C,D,E,F,G,A,B},
{C,D,E,F#,G,A,B },
....
{C,D,E,F,G,A,B6), {C,D,E6,F,G,A,B6},
{C,D,E,F#,G,A,B}, {C,D,E,F,G,A,B, .... Each pcset on this list is a
Cohn-flip of the set that precedes it, and also of the set that follows it.
Harmonictriads,as Cohn sets mod 12, give rise to shorter,less exhaustive Cohn cycles, e.g.... {C,E,G}, {C,E6,G}, {C,E6,A6}, {B,D#,G#},
{B,E,G#}, {B,E,G}, {C,E,G},....
Part 2: Cohn functions; definitions and examples
From here on I shall present my own work, one generalizationof
Cohn's (and by no means the only one of interest).
Pcsets-and other related set-theoretic configurations,as we shall
see-can be representedby certainfunctions, functions which have as
argumentsthe numbersmod 12, or more generallymod N. The C major
diatonic set mod 12, for example, can be representedby the function f
182

whose values are f(0)=yes, f(1)=no, f(2)=yes, f(3)=no, f(4)=yes, f(5)=
yes, f(6)=no, f(7)=yes, f(8)=no, f(9)=yes, f(10)=no, f(ll)=yes. This
function assigns the value "yes"to each pc-numberthat is a memberof
the designatedpcset, and the value "no"to each pc-numberthat is not.
We shall representthe above functionby the symbol (ynynyynynyny).
The 7-35 set class can also be represented a functionthathas numby
bers mod 7 as arguments,and numbersmod 12 as values. The function
assigns to each numberj mod 7 the j-th intervalof the diatonic scale. So
f(0)=2: the 0th intervalof the scale is 2 semitones.f(1)=2: the next interval of the scale is 2 semitones. f(2)=l: the next intervalof the scale is 1
semitone.And so forth:f(3)=2, f(4)=2, f(5)=2, f(6)=1. We representthis
functionby the symbol (2212221).
In like fashion the C majortriad,as a set in the mod 12 universe,can
be represented the mod 12 function(ynnnynnynnn).
And the transpoby
sitional set class of "majortriad"can be represented the mod 3 funcby
tion (435), where the numbers4, 3, and 5 are intervalsmod 12.
of
Cohn-properties these variouspcsets (or set classes) arereflectedin
certain properties of the mod N functions that represent the various
pcsets (or set classes).
The concept of Cohn flippingcan be extendedto functionswith arguments mod N as follows.
DEFINITION 2.1: A mod N function is Cohn flipped when an
exchange of different(NB) values at adjacent(NB) argumentsgives rise
to a rotatedretrograde the originalfunction.
of
For example, consider the mod 12 function (ynynnnnnnnny),
which
representsthe pcset {B,C,D }. Let us exchange the different(NB) values
y and n at the adjacent(NB) arguments0 and 1. We obtain the function
which represents {B,C#,D}. The exchanged function
(nyynnnnnnnny),
values are italicized. If we startat the italicizedy and read the new function circularlybackwardstherefrom,we obtain (ynynnnnnnnny),
which
has
(ignoring italics) is the original function. So (ynynnnnnnnny) been
Cohn-flippedinto (nyynnnnnnnny), the above definition.
by
Or consider the mod 3 function (129), where the numbers1, 2, and 9
are mod 12 intervals. This function represents the transpositionalset
class of {B,C,D }. If we exchangethe different(NB) values 1 and 2 at the
adjacent (NB) arguments0 and 1, we obtain the new function (219),
which representsthe transpositional class of {B,C#,D}. If we startat
set
the italicized 1 and read the new function circularlybackwardstherefrom, we obtain (129), which (ignoringitalics) is the originalfunction.
We can now define "Cohnfunctions."
DEFINITION2.2: A Cohnfunction is a functionwith arguments
mod
N that can be Cohn-flippedin two differentways-i.e. at two different
locations.
adjacent-argument
For a Cohn function,N must be greaterthan2. (A functionmod 2 has
183

location.) For the rest of this article,in cononly one adjacent-argument
sideringfunctionsmod N, we shall assume thatN is 3 or greater.
Functions that representCohn sets are Cohn functions in a natural
way. For instance, let us consider the function (ynynynnynynn),which
representsthe Cohn set {C,D,E,G,A}. An exchange of differing (NB)
values at the adjacent(NB) arguments4 and 5 (mod 12) yields the new
function(ynynnynynynn),
which representsthe pcset {C,D,F,G,A . If we
startwith the rightmosty of the new functionas written,andreadthe new
function circularly backwards therefrom, we obtain (ynynynnynynn),
which is the original function (ignoringitalics). So the orginalfunction,
(ynynynnynynn),can be Cohn-flippedat arguments4 and 5. It can also
be Cohn-flippedat arguments11 and 0: the exchange of differingvalues
at those two adjacent argumentsproduces the new function (nnynynnynyny), which represents the pcset {B,D,E,G,A}. Reading the new
function backwardsas it standson the page-we do not have to do any
which is the originalfunction
rotatinghere-we obtain(ynynynnynynn),
(ignoring italics). So our function can be Cohn-flippedin two different
4
ways-at arguments and 5, or at arguments11 and0. It is a Cohn function.
If we representthe transpositionalset class of {C,D,E,G,A} by the
function(22323), an interval-valued
functionmod 5, then thatfunctionis
a Cohn function.It Cohn-flipsat arguments1 and 2: the exchangeof values here produces (23223), which, when readbackwards
and suitably
rotated, produces (22323), the original function. It also Cohn-flips at
arguments4 and 0 (mod 5): the exchange of values there produces
(32322), which, when readbackwards,
produces (22323), the original
function.
The study of Cohn functions is thus one way to generalize the study
of Cohn sets. (It is by no means the only way!) As we shall see, we can
catalogueall possible Cohn functions, so the generalizationis fruitful.It
is also useful because we have made no stipulationswhateverupon the
things thatmay be the values of a Cohn function.The values may be the
symbols "yes"and "no";they may be variousintervalsmod 12; they may
be variousdynamics,or register-numbers, characteristic
or
markingslike
{tenuto,staccato,slurred,detache,jt6 }, or a myriadof othersuch musically pertinentsorts of things.
For one example, let us use the symbols a, u, and r to denote "acand "rest."A repeating accent-patternin comcented," "unaccented,"
poundtriplemetercan then be represented the mod 9 function(aurauby
ruar). This is a Cohn function. It Cohn-flips at arguments0 and 1:

Example2
Here is anotherCohn functionthat goes beyond normalpcset theory.
It involvespitch-classstructures just intonation.Let the symbols M, m,
in
and p representrespectively a just majorthird (5:4), a just minor third
minorthird(32:27, a syntonic comma less than
(6:5), and a Pythagorean
a just minorthird).The exact numericalratiosare not the point here;the
point is that these categories correspondconceptuallyto aspects of just
scales as promulgatedwidely during the 19th Century,beginning with
Moritz Hauptmann.3 top row of Example 2 shows the pitch classes
The
of the just C majorscale as Hauptmann
lays them out.
The bottomrow of the example shows the succession of intervalsfor
the series of pitch classes. Upper-casepcs relate among themselves by
fifths;so do lower-casepcs. Upper-casepcs relateto adjacentlower-case
pcs by just thirds.The intervaldF would be a just minorthird,but lowercase d is not in Hauptmann's
C-majorsystem;it is pre-emptedby uppercase D, the fifth of G. Instead of dF, the system includes the dyad DF,
which spans a Pythagoreanminorthird,reflectingthe constructionof D
as threefifths from F.
The function we wish to consider is the interval-series(MmMmMmp), a mod 7 function.It is a Cohnfunction.It Cohn-flipsat arguments

We
(MmMmMmp). shall call this "them/p flip."
Cohn-flipsof the interval-seriescorrespondto modulationsof thejust
C-majorsystem. Example 3a shows how the system becomes a just eminor system by the M/p flip. (e, a, and b triads are all just in this system.)And example 3b shows how the system becomes ajust a-minorsystem by the m/p flip. (a, d, and e triadsare all just in this system.) From
this phenomenon we can construct an "infiniteCohn-cycle"-better, a
"Cohn-chain"--ofmodulatingjust majorand minor keys: ... dm, FM,
am, CM, em, GM, bm, DM, f#m, .... Every pair of adjacentkeys in this
chain is relatedvia a pertinentCohn-flipof the interval-seriesinvolved.
Here is yet another3-valued Cohn function of musical interest.It is
the mod 7 function (xyzxzyz). It Cohn-flips at arguments 1 and 2:
into (xyzxzyz). It also Cohn-flips at argu(xzyxzyz) retrograde-rotates
ments 0 and 6: (zyzxzyx) is the retrograde (xyzxzyz).
of
If we use the argumentsmod 7 to label successive pitch classes of the
C majorscale, then the argumentsthat receive the value x, for the function (xyzxzyz), are arguments0 and 3, the numbersthat label pcs C and
F. The argumentsthat receive the value y are 1 and 5, the numbersthat
label pcs D andA; while the argumentsthatreceive the value z are 2, 4,
and6, the numbersthatlabel pcs E, G, andB. The Cohnfunctioncan thus
representa partitionof the scale into three pcsets: X={C,F}, Y={D,A},
andZ={E,G,B }. Underthis representation, Cohn flips of the function
the
to "Cohnflips"of the partitionas a whole. By exchangingthe
correspond
adjacentpcs D and E (arguments 1 and 2 mod 7), one transformsthe
XYZ partition into the diatonically-inverted partition X'={C,F},
Y'={E,A), Z'={D,G,B}. And by exchanging the adjacentpcs C and B
(arguments0 and 6 mod 7), one transformsthe XYZ partitioninto the
diatonically-inverted
partitionX"= {B,F}, Y"={D,A }, Z"= E,G,C}.
We shall call such a partitiona Cohnpartition (of its mod N "scale").
186

of
The Cohn structure the functioninduces a Cohn cycle of partitions,as
displayedin example 4.
Otherinterestingapplicationscan be found for 3-valued Cohn functions. David Clampitt(in an unpublishedletter)pointedout thatthe interval series for many normally-ordered
pcsets mod 12 are 3-valued Cohn
functions.So, for example, pentachordsof Forte-types5-3, 5-6, and 5-7
have respective interval-series (11217), (11316), and (11415); each
series can be represented the mod 5 Cohn function(xxyxz). The Cohn
by
gives rise to "modulating"
structuring
cycles among prime and inverted
forms of the sets. Example 5 shows how this works in the case of Forteset 5-7.
The transitionfrom each stage to the next, in example 5, replaces the
"plagal" division of some dyad (e.g. C#-D-F#)by a corresponding
"authentic"
division (e.g. C#-F-F#), vice-versa.The cycle of the examor
each pcset down a semitone at every alternatestage, so it
ple transposes
will cycle throughall 24 unorderedforms of set 5-7. Othersuch cycles
will be shorter,e.g. that shown in example 6 for some sets of class 5-32.

Each pcset in the cycle of example 6 is transformed T3 two stages

Clampitt,in his letter,listed exhaustivelythe many pcset classes that
have interval series representableby 3-valued Cohn functions. All trichordswhose interval-series
have threedistinctvalues aresuch. Example
7 demonstrates the intervalseries (129).
for
In the example, the first transitioncorrespondsto a Cohn flip of the
pcsets involved-C# is adjacentto C as a pitch class. But the second transition is not a Cohn flip of pcsets-E is not adjacentto B as a pitch class.
Neverthelessthe transitionis generatedby an exchange of distinct adjacent values in the interval series, 2 and 9 being adjacentvalues for the
mod 3 function (219).
Indeed any 3-valued function mod 3 is de facto a Cohn function.

(xyz) also Cohn-flipsat arguments
1 and 2: (xzy) is a rotatedretrogradeof (xyz). (xyz) thus Cohn-flips at
threedifferentadjacent-argument
pairs.

Any 2-valuedfunctionmod 3 is also de facto a Cohn function. (xxy),
in all generality,Cohn-flips at arguments1 and 2; it also Cohn-flips at
arguments2 and 0. It does not, however,Cohn-flipat arguments0 and 1,
because the values of the functionthere are not (NB) distinct.
It follows that the interval series for any trichordmod 12, the augmentedtriadexcepted,is a Cohn functionmod 3. So any trichord,except
for the augmentedtriad,can be cycled in the mannerof example 7.
Example 8 illustratesthis for a 2-valued intervalseries.
Since the 3-valued Cohn function (xyz) Cohn-flipsaboutany pair of
arguments,
example 7, whose trichordhas a 3-valuedintervalseries, can
be expandedto a much more complex graph.Example9 shows a portion

have. But Cohn functionswith more thanthreedistinctvalues come with
a very special structure.
To illustrate,let us considerthe two-valuedmod 3 "rootfunction"fl =
(yyn), where y and n standfor "yes" and "no"respectively.From fl we
derive a two-valued mod 6 Cohn function f2 = (yn yn ny). The blanks
have no mathematicalsignificance; they are only there to structurethe
visual field suggestively.The consecutive values of f2 are the values of
the root function fl, alternatingwith their respective antitheses.f2 can
thus be regardedas a series of three "antithesispairs."
To proceed farther,we next select some palindromicstring of valFor
ues-call it P.P may be any palindromewhatsoever. instanceP might
be null; or P might consist of the lone symbol y, or the lone symbol n, or
the lone symbol (say) r, where r is a new symbol. Or P might consist of
the palindromenn, or yy, or rr. Or P might consist of the palindrome
And
qxvryynnnabcbannnyyrvxq. so forth. Let L be the length of P.
Fromf2 we now form f3 = (yn P yn P ny P). f3 is a function mod(6+
3L). f3 is a Cohn function. Specifically, the exchange of distinct values
for f3 at arguments0 and 1 yields (ny P yn P ny P), which is a rotatedretrogradeof (yn P yn P ny P), which is f3 itself, ignoring italics. And the
2+L and 3+L
exchangeof distinctvalues for f3 at the adjacentarguments
P ny P ny P), which is a rotatedretrograde (yn P yn P ny P),
of
yields (yn
which is f3 itself, ignoring italics.
In case the palindromeP is void (L=0), f3 is simply f2. Reinterpreting
y as "low"and n as "high,"we can use f2 = (low high low high high low)
to model thematic aspects of the Hauptmotivfor the finale of Schoenberg's ThirdQuartetOp. 30. The motiv, heardin the first violin at measure 1, presents pitches E5, D#6, E5, D#6, C#6, D5 as four eighths and
two quarters,
bowed in successive pairs.The violin presentsanotherversion of the same contourmotiv duringmeasure2.
In case P is the palindromecomprisingthe one symbol r, f3 is the mod
9 Cohn function(yn r yn r ny r). If we interpret to mean "accented"
and
y
n to mean "unaccented," r to mean "rest,"
and
then f3 has the same structureas the function(aurauruar),
studiedearlierin connectionwith example 1(p. 185).
In case P is the palindromecomprisingthe symbol-stringnn, then f3
is the mod 12 function(yn nn yn nn ny nn). Readingthe symbols as "yes"
and "no"in the familiarway mod 12, we find that f3 here can represent
the Cohn set {C,E,A}. And so forth.
We could also start with the two-valued mod 5 "root function"fl=
(yynyn).We derivethe two-valuedmod 10 Cohn functionf2 by alternating fl's values with theirrespectiveantitheses:f2=(yn yn ny yn ny). And
then, P being any palindromeof length L, we trope each antithesis-pair
of f2 by an insertedP, therebyobtainingthe Cohn function f3=(yn P yn
P ny P yn P ny P). f3 is a Cohn functionmod (10+5L).
190

In general,if we startfrom any of certain"rootfunctions"mod K and
any palindromeP of length L, we can derive Cohn functions mod (K
(2+L)) in this fashion. The mathematicalniceties will be providedlater.
As we shall note, K mustbe odd.An appropriate
"rootfunction"fl is not
necessarily itself a Cohn function mod K, but it can be derived from a
very specific functionfO mod K in a way we shall examine later.fO is a
Cohn function and much more.
Part 3: prolegomena
In this and the following partsof the presentessay, we shall construct
and catalogue all possible Cohn functions.There are only a few generic
types of them, and we have already studied specific examples of each
possible type.
In parts 4 through7 we shall constructeach generic type of Cohn
function.Part8 will thenexplainin whatsense everypossible Cohnfunction must be one of the already-studied
types.
To simplify matters we shall consider only those Cohn functions
which are "0/1 situated." Cohn function is such when one of its Cohn
A
flips occurs at the arguments0 and 1, mod N. It is clear that Cohn functions, in general,are the variousrotationsof 0/1 situatedCohn functions.
Part 4: Two-valued generator-typeCohn functions
The firsttype of Cohnfunctionwe shall constructis whatwe shall call
the "two-valued
generator
type."Example 10 illustratesa particular
specimen.
The top row of example 10(a) lists the numbersmod 12 as multiples

The bottomrow of example 10(a) assigns to each argument mod 12 the

We shall need to define, first,what is meantby a "generator
an
DEFINITION By a generatormodN we shall understand inte4.1:
ger G, between 1 and N-l inclusive, whose multiplesmod N exhaustall
the numbers
mod N. Thatis, the set {G,2G,3G, ... ,(N-1)G,NG=0},when
we reduceeach of its numbersmod N, includeseach numbermod N.
Since thereare N listed multiplesof G above, and N distinctnumbers
mod N, each numbermod N will appearonce and only once on the list.
The generatorsmod 12 are 1, 5, 7, and 11.
A generatorG mod N necessarilypossesses several other interesting
propertieswe shall now survey.Any numbermod N which possesses any
one of these propertieswill be a generator.
DEFINITION4.2: The [additive] order of a numberj mod N is the
smallest positive integer K for which Kj = 0 mod N (i.e. for which N
divides Kj).
Since Nj=0 mod N, the order K of j is always either equal to N or
smallerthanN.
For G to be a generatormod N, it is both necessaryand sufficientthat
the orderof G be N itself (and not any smallernumber).For those interested, a proof will soon be supplied.
Also: for G to be a generator
mod N, it is both necessaryand sufficient
that the integersG and N be relativelyprime (have no common divisor
greaterthan 1).
DEFINITION4.3: A unit mod N is a numberu mod N such that 1 is
some multiple of u, mod N. That is, there is some v mod N satisfying
uv=l mod N. So, for example, 7 is a unit mod 10 (since 7 times 3 is 1
mod 10).
The numbers1, 5, 7, and 11 are all units mod 12-each of those numbers, multipliedby itself, produces 1 mod 12.
For G to be a generatormod N, it is both necessaryand sufficientthat
G be a unit.
We sum up our observationsso far in a tighterform.

THEOREM4.4: Conditions (a) through (d) below are all logically
equivalent.Each conditionimplies all the others.
(a) G is a generatormod N.
(b) The orderof G, mod N, is N.
(c) As integers,G and N are relativelyprime (have no common divisor bigger than 1).
(d) G is a unit mod N.
We shall accept this theorem as valid. For readerswho are curious,
AppendixA (p. 213) gives a proof.
Havingdevotedsome study to the propertiesof generatorsmod N, we
now continue with the study of two-valued generator-type
Cohn functions.
In example 10, we began by listing the numbersmod 12 as consecutive multiplesof the generator5. In the generalcase where G is a generator mod N, we shall begin analogously,listing the numbersmod N as
consecutivemultiplesof the generator startingwith G andendingwith
G,
0=NG. We obtainthe list of example 1l(a).
Here M is the number such that MG=1. Then (M+1)G = MG+G =
1+G, (M+2)G = MG+2G = 1+2G, and so forth.
The numberson the list add an incrementof G, mod N, at each successive entry. As indicated on example 1 (a), we shall call the list
"<FROMG TO 0 STEP G>," understanding
"mod N" where that does
not need to be specified.
We shall be devoting special attentionto that part of the list which
extends from G through 1 inclusive. This sublist is shown in example
l(b); it will be called "<FROMG TO 1 STEP G>." We shall also be
devoting special attentionto thatpartof the big list which extends from
1+G through0 inclusive. This sublist is shown in example 1l(c); it will
be called "<FROM1+G TO 0 STEP G>."
A special note is in order.Example 11 shows entriesof 2G, 1+2G, and
the like in its visual field. In some cases, these numbers may not lie
within the indicatedspans.The notation"<G, 2G,.... MG=1>"means:
193

"Startwith G, andkeep addingG's until you get to 1; then stop."Now the
numberG=1 is always a generatormod N; in that case M=1 and the list
<FROMG TO 1 STEP G> comprisesG alone-the number2 will not be
on the list. Similarly,G=(N-1) is always a generatormod N; in that case
1+G = 0 mod N and the list <FROM 1+G TO 0 STEP G> comprises 0
alone-the number 1+2G will not be on the list, nor will the number
(N-1)G. For purposesof reasoningand/orcomputing,the logical definitions of the sublists should be used, not their visual appearanceson
example 11. Logically, <FROM G TO 1 STEP G> is that series which
lists all consecutive multiplesof G between 1G=Gand MG=1 inclusive.
When M=1 (if G=1), the list will containonly one entry.If M=2, the list
will containexactly two entries,namely 1G=Gand 2G=MG=1. The following logical definitionsof the lists at issue will be useful later,for precise reasoning.
4.5: Given G a unitmod N, andthe integerM between
DEFINITIONS
1 and N-l inclusive such thatMG=1 mod N, then
The list <FROMG TO 1 STEP G> arrangesin orderthose multiples
mG of G such thatthe integerm lies between 1 and M inclusive.
The list <FROM 1+G TO 0 STEP G> arrangesin orderthose multiples nG of G such thatthe integern lies between M+1 andN inclusive.
The list <FROMG TO 0 STEP G> arrangesin orderthose multiples
nG of G such that the integern lies between 1 and N inclusive.
The readeris remindedthat we are always supposing N greaterthan
2, in our presentinvestigations.
Example 12(a) copies over example 10(a). Reviewing it, we see that
the Cohn function there was obtainedby assigning the value x to every
argumentmod 12 <FROM5 TO 1 STEP 5>, and assigning the value y to
mod 12 <FROM6 TO 0 STEP 5>. The constructiongenevery argument
eralizes for any generatorG mod N, as displayedin example 12(b). (This
examplesupposesthatthe lengthsof the pertinentsublistsare sufficiently
large to admit the numbers2G etc. mod N.) That is, the function displayed in example 12(b) is a Cohn function. More formally, using the
logical definitionsof the sublists given in Definitions4.2 above, we have
the following theorem.
THEOREM4.6: Given a generatorG mod N, define the mod N function f as follows: for every argument on the list <FROMG TO 1 STEP
j
G>, set f(j)=x; for every argument on the list <FROM 1+G TO 0 STEP
j
G>, set f(j)=y.
Then f is a Cohn function. It Cohn-flips at arguments0 and 1, and it
Cohn-flipsat argumentsG and 1+G.
The theoremwill not be provedhere.An earlierdraftof this article,in

large, would not be happy with such text.
We next turnour attentionto an interestingconsequence of the theorem. We note first that a two-valued generator-typeCohn function can
always be rotatedinto itself, after a suitable single exchange of distinct
values at numericallyadjacentarguments.
THEOREM
4.7: Given the situationof Theorem4.6, let f' be the function which exchanges the values of f at the adjacentarguments0 and 1.
Then f' is a rotationof f (as well as a rotated-retrograde).
Specifically,for
all arguments f'(j) = f(j+G).
j,
As above, a formalproof is not given here. The converseof Theorem
4.7 is also true.
THEOREM4.8: Let f be a functionmod N, with f(0) and f(1) distinct
values;let f' be definedby f'(0)=f(l); f'(l)=f(0); f'(j)=f(j) for otherargumentsj. Supposethatf' is some rotationof f. Suppose specificallythatG
is the order-interval rotation,so that f'(j)=f(j+G) for all arguments
of
j
mod N. Then G is a generatormod N, and f is a two-valued generatortype Cohn function.f Cohn-flips,specifically,at arguments0-and-1, and
also at argumentsG-and-(l+G).
A formal proof is not providedhere. We can combine Theorems4.7
and 4.8 into a single theorem:
THEOREM4.9: The following categories of function mod N are the
same:
Cohn function, and
(a) a two-valuedgenerator-type
(b) a function which can be rotated into itself, after distinct values
have been exchanged at some pair of numericallyadjacentarguments.
Part 5: Three-valued generator type Cohn functions
Let N be an odd number.Let G be a generatormod N; let M be the
positive integer less than N such that MG=1 mod N. Either M or N-M
must be even, and only one of the two is even. (If both were odd, or if
both were even, then N would be even, contraryto supposition.)
If N-M is even we can replacethe generatorG with the new generator

Example 13
G' = N-G = -G mod N. Setting M' = N-M, we see that M'G' = (N-M)
(-G) = -NG + MG = 1 mod N. And M' is even. So, to considerthe generic
situation,it suffices to considerthe case where M is even.
Example 13 is analogousto example 12(b) before. It displays a function f with threedistinctvalues, x, y, and z. Like the functionof example
on
12(b), f here takeson the value y for all arguments the rightside of the
example, <FROM 1+G TO 0 STEP G>. The currentf takes on two distinct values for G-multipleson the left side of the example. For odd intemG
gers m between 1 andM-1 inclusive,f assigns the argument the value
x; for even integersm between 2 and M inclusive, f assigns the argument
mG the value z. Since M itself is even, f does assume all threeof the values: f(0) = y, f(G) = x, and f(MG) = f(1) = z. (M, which is a unit, cannot
be 0; it must be 2 or greater.)
THEOREM5.1: The function f of example 13 is a Cohn function. It
Cohn-flipsat arguments0-and-1, and it Cohn-flipsat argumentsG-and(1+G).
The proof is not given.
DEFINITION5.2: A function of the sort just constructedwill be
called a three-valuedgenerator-typeCohnfunction.
The function is "three-valued"
because we are supposing x distinct
from z. The machineryof the theoremwould workperfectlywell if z and
x were equal, but in thatcase we would simply have a two-valuedgenerator-typeCohnfunctionof the sortexaminedin Part4: example 13 would
collapse into example 12(b).
The most general three-valuedgenerator-typeCohn function is any
rotationor retrograde-rotation the generic Cohn functiondisplayedin
of
example 13.
NOTE5.3. It will be well to stressonce more thatthree-valued
generator-typeCohn functions can be found or constructedonly when N is
odd. They can always be found when N is odd (and greater than 1),
because in thatcase, given any generatorG with MG = 1, eitherM or (NM) mustbe even-and if (N-M) is even, it can be consideredas an M' for
the generatorG' = (N-1)G. These matters were discussed toward the
beginningof Part5 above.
For an example, let us considerN=9. Since 7 and 9 have no common

divisorgreaterthan 1, G=7 is a generator
mod 9. HereM=4, since 4 times
7 = 1 modulo 9. Example 14(a) lists the numbersmod 9 in the formatof
example 13, and constructsthe correspondingCohn-functionf as indicated.Example 14(b) "unscrambles" numbersmod 9, puttingthem in
the
theirusual order,and writes beneatheach j the corresponding
value of f
that lies below j on example 14(a). Reading off f-values in the orderof
example 14(b) we can denote f in our earliersymbolismas (yzyxyzyxy).
We can then check directly that f is a Cohn function: (zyyxyzyxy)
retrograde-rotates
into(yzyxyzyxy), which is f, ignoring italics. And
into
(yzyxyzyyx)retrograde-rotates (yzyxyzyxy),whichis f, ignoringitalics. As our abstractwork has told us, f Cohn-flipsat 0-and-1, and also at
7-and-8.
As anotherexample, let us take N=7 (remember, must be odd) and
N
G=2. (Since 2 and 7 are relativelyprime,2 is a generatormod 7.) In this
case M=4, which is even, so we can constructthe generic three-valued
Cohn functionin this particular
case as follows: forj = 2, 4, 6, and 1, f(j)
= x, z, x, and z respectively;forj = 3, 5, and 0, f(j) = y. Thus forj = 0, 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, and6, f(j) = respectivelyy, z, x, y, z, y, andx. In ourearliersymof
bolism, f is the function(yzxyzyx). f can model a partition the C major
scale into sets X, Y, and Z: X comprisesjust those notesj whose f-values
are x, and so forth.Thus X = {E,B}, Y = {C,F,A}, and Z = {D,G}. This
is a form of the "Cohn-partition"
studiedearlier,a partitionof the scale
into a triadandtwo fifths.Cohn-flipping functionat arguments
the
0-and1 models exchangingnotes 0-and-l (C and D) between pertinentsets of
the partition:this yields the new partitionX' = {EB ), Y' = {D,F,A}, Z'
= {C,G}, a diatonicinversionof the originalpartition.Cohn-flippingthe
function at argumentsG-and-(l+G), i.e. at arguments2-and-3, models
exchangingnotes 2-and-3 (E and F) between pertinentsets of the partition: this yields the new partitionX" = {F,B), Y" = {C,E,A}, Z" =
{D,G }, a diatonicinversionof the originalpartition.

Not every three-valuedCohn function is of generatortype. Some are
of the type we shall study next, which we shall call the "antithesis-palindrome type."The rhythmicfunction of example 1, which was three-valued, was of that type. We discussed this informallyat the end of Part2.
There,we noted as well thatCohn functionsof the antithesis-palindrome
type may have an indefinitelylarge numberof distinct values. In Parts6
and 7, which follow, we shall explore that. Before studying the full
antithesis-palindrome
type of function, in Part7, we shall first study the
pure antithesis-pair
type in Part6. Here the palindromeis null, and this
type of functionhas only two values.
Part 6: The (two-valued) antithesis-pair type of Cohn function
We shall constructhere the most general Cohn function f, of antithe0-and-1, andthathas symbolic
sis-pairtype, thatCohn-flipsat arguments
values x and y, with f(0)=y and f(l)=x.6 We startwith an odd numberK,
greaterthan or equal to 3.
Example 15, stage 0, displays a certainfunctionfO mod K. The arguments for fO are listed as the multiples of 2, mod K, in order<FROM2
TO 0 STEP 2>. The integerK being odd, the integerK-l will be even; a
verticaldivideris placed on the example afterK-1. Then, since K-l is the
same as -1 mod K, the next entry on the argumentlist of the example is
(-1)+2 or 1 mod K. Successive increments of 2 then continue the list
throughthe odd integersfrom 1 to K inclusive, where of course K=0 mod
K. The values of fO are given as f(k)=x or f(k)=y, dependingon whether
the integerk, lying between 1 and K inclusive, is even or odd.
The reader'sattentionis drawnonce more to the restrictionthat K be
odd. Since 2 and K have no common divisors greaterthan 1, 2 is a generatormod K, andthe formatof the example lists all the numbersmod K.
(If K were even, the multiples of 2 mod K would list only half the numbers mod K-just the even numbersmod K.)
Attention is also drawn to the fact that the function fO has (K-1)/2
argumentswith x-values and (K+1)/2 argumentswith y-values. It thus
assumes,the value y exactly one more time, thanit assumes the value x.7
Stage 1 of example 15 keeps the function values from stage 0 as they
lie; it multiplies all the argumentsof stage 0 by a unit (any unit) u mod
K. A new functionfl mod K is therebyconstructed.The argumentsof fl
arehere listed as consecutivemultiplesof the generator mod K. (Since
2u
2 and u are both units, so is 2u.) Argumentson the list <FROM2u TO -u
STEP 2u> have x-values; argumentson the list <FROM u TO 0 STEP
2u> have y-values. The functionfl will be called the rootfunctionfor the
Cohn function eventually generated.fl itself need not necessarily be a
Cohn functionitself; it is of course generatedin a very specific way from
the very specific (Cohn) function fO. The root function fl, like the func198

Stage 2 of example 15 keeps the functionvalues from stage 1 as they
lie; it replaces the numberu mod K by the numberv=2u mod 2K. (For
example:if K is 7 and u is 5 mod 7, v is 10 mod 14.) This process begins
to constructa new function f2 mod 2K. The even argumentsfor f2 are
here listed as consecutive multiples of the number 2v mod 2K. Arguments on the list <FROM2v TO -v STEP 2v> have x-values; arguments
on the list <FROM v TO 0 STEP 2v> have y-values. f2 is not yet
completely defined: we know its values so far only for even arguments
mod 2K.
Stage 3 of example 15 finishes the definitionof function f2, by providing its argumentsfor odd values mod 2K. For each even argument
j
mod 2K, the odd argumentl+j is assigned the "antithetic"
value, from
the value assigned at argumentj. That is, f2(l+j) is defined as y or x,
accordingto whetherf2(j) is x or y respectively.

Example 16
THEOREM6.1: f2, as defined at stage 3 of example 15, is a Cohn
function. It Cohn-flips, specifically, at arguments0-and-l, and it also
Cohn-flipsat argumentsv-and-(l+v).
For example, let us take K=7 and u = 5 mod 7, so thatv = 10 mod 14.
Stages 0 through3 of example 16 thenprovideus with the antithesis-type
Cohn functionf2 mod 14 displayedat stage 3. We can write out f2 in the
conventionalnotationused earlier,as (yx yx xy xy yx yx xy). The blanks
here have no mathematicalsignificance;they are only used to isolate the
antithesis-pairsat even-and-succesive-oddargumentsmod 14. By our
construction,the Cohn functionf2 will Cohn-flipat arguments
O-and-1,
and also at argumentsv-and-(l+v), i.e. at arguments10-and-1l. We can
check that out by inspection: (xy yx xy xy yx yx xy) retrograde-rotates
into (yx yx xy xy yx yx xy) ; while (yx yx xy xy yx xy xy) retrograderotatesinto (yx yx xy xy yx yx xy).

Part 7: antithesis-palindrome type Cohn functions.
Let us consider the function f2 just discussed in connection with
example 16 at the end of Part 6 above. If P is any palindromeof any
length, involving any symbols whatsoever,the pertinentadjacent-argument exchanges and retrograde-rotation
behavior of f2 will not be
changed in essence, should we insert the string P between successive
Thatis, the functionf3 = (yx P yx P xy P xy P yx P yx P
antithesis-pairs.
xy P) will be a Cohn function. By inspection:(xy P yx P xy P xy P yx P
into
yx P xy P) retrograde-rotates (yx P yx P xy P xy P yx P yx P xy P);
while (yx P yx P xy P xy P yx P xy P xy P) retrograde-rotates (yx P
into
yx P xy P xy P yx P yx P xy P).
If the palindromeis of length L, then the expressionabove articulates
into segmentsof length 2+L, each segmentconsisting eitherof "xy P" or
of "yx P."There will be K such segments. So the "N" of the enlarged
function"modN" will be K times 2+L.
The idea is intuitivelyclear enough. Workingout the specifics of the
involved is a bit fussy. The niceties will be handledin
number-juggling
this partof the presentessay.
We startwith an odd numberK and a unit u mod K, as before. Let P
be any palindrome; L be its length. If L=O(so the palindromeis null),
let
we have the case just discussed in Part6 above, so we shall supposehere
that L is 1 or greater.If L is 1, we shall denote the sole symbol of the
palindromeby p . If L is 2 or more, we shall use the symbols p1, p2, ...
to denote the successive symbols of the palindromeP = p p2 ... p(L-l)
pL, so that pl=pL, p2=p(L-l) and so forth. Let J = 2+L. Let N be K
times J.
Stages 0 and 1 of example 17 proceedexactly as did stages 0 and 1 for
example 15 earlier.At stage 2, where example 15 replaced u by v=2u
mod 2K, example 17 more generally replaces u by v=Ju mod JK. This
amountsto multiplyingall the argument
numbersmod K of stage 1 by J,
to obtainthe argumentsmod JK listed in stage 2.
At stage 2, the function f2 is defined only for those argumentsmod
N=JK thatare multiplesof J. Stage 3, like stage 3 of example 15, assigns
"antithesis"values to f2 for those argumentsmod N that are 1-morethan-some-multiple-of-J.
We have yet to assign f2-values to argumentsmod N that are neither
multiples of J, nor 1 more than multiples of J. Stage 4 of example 17
assigns such values. "smoJ"stands for "some multiple of J."Thus if a
numbermod N is (smoJ)+0, its f2-value has already been assigned at
stage 3. The same is the case for a numberthatis (smoJ)+l. If a number
n is (smoJ)+2 (i.e. 2 more than some multipleof J), stage 4 assigns f2(n)
the value p , wherep is the firstsymbol of the palindromeP. Since P is
a palindrome,pl is the same symbol as pL, the last symbol of the palin201

drome.The fact is noted on the visual display for stage 4. If a numbern
is (smoJ)+3 (i.e. 3 more than some multiple of J, should there be any
such), stage 4 assigns f2(n) the value p2, where p2 is the second symbol
of the palindromeP. Since P is a palindrome,p2 is the same symbol as
p(L-1), the penultimatesymbol of the palindrome.The fact is noted on
the visual displayfor stage 4. And so forth:if a numbern is (smoJ)+(r+
1),
where the integerr is between 1 andL inclusive, stage 4 assigns f2(n) the
value pr, the r-th symbol of the palindrome.Since P is a palindrome,pr
is the same symbol as p(L+1-r).
We see from the visual display that an argumentmod N which is
(smoJ)+2 is assigned the same f2-value, as is an argumentwhich is
(smoJ)+(J-l); an argumentwhich is (smoJ)+3 (should there be any) is
assigned the same f2-value, as an argumentwhich is (smoJ)+(J-2);and
so forth.
THEOREM7.1: f2, as fully defined at stage 4, is a Cohn function. It
Cohn-flipsat arguments0-and-1; it also Cohn-flipsat argumentsv-and(1+v).
The proof is not given.
The function f2, with values as at stage 4 of example 17, can be constructedfor any N, with a free choice of unit u mod K, providedonly that
K be an odd divisor of N (greaterthan 1). The function can thereforebe
constructedfor any N which has a properodd divisor,which is to say for
any N that is neithera power of 2 nor a prime number.
Example 18 providesa specific case of the generic structure.
Stages 0
and 1 copy over the same stages from example 16, taking K=7 and u=5
mod 7. Now we takea palindromeP of lengthL=4 -let's give it the symbols pqqp.Then J = L+2 = 6, and N = JK = 42.
Stage 2 of example 18 multipliesthe numbersmod 7 of stage 1 by J=6
mod 42. Stage 3 thus assigns f2-values to all numbersthatare some multiple of 6 (smo6) mod 42. Stage 3 then assigns f2-values to all numbers
that are (smo6)+1 mod 42. If n is smo6 mod 42, stage 3 assigns 1+n the
f2-value antitheticto n's value.
Stage 4 of example 18 completes the assignment of f2-values by
assigning numbers that are (smo6)+2, or (smo6)+3, or (smo6)+4, or
(smo6)+5, the f2-values p or q or q or p respectively,i.e. the consecutive
symbols of the palindromep q q p. On the lower right side of stage 4, the
palindromecan be read downwards.
All the values of f2, for every argumentmod 42, can now be readoff
in
notastages 3 and4 of example 18. f2 can be represented our standard
tion by (yx pqqp yx pqqp xy pqqp xy pqqp yx pqqp yx pqqp xy pqqp).

Part 8: The above types of Cohn function are exhaustive.
We have now explored several generic sorts of Cohn functions (that
0
Cohn flip at arguments and 1). In Parts4 and 5 we exploredtwo-valued
and three-valuedgenerator-typeCohn functios. In Part 7 we explored
type Cohn functions, a species that subsumesthe
antithesis-palindrome
functionsof Part6 as special cases.
The following fact is true:Any Cohn function must be eitherof generator type (two-valued or three-valued),or of antithesis-palindrome
type. We have thereforenow constructedgeneric examples for all possible types of Cohn functions.
There will be no formal proof of that fact here-as I statedearlier,I
am eschewing such proofs in this paper,to conserve space and to avoid
wearying readers who have limited tolerance for formal mathematical
prose. Still, it will be useful to breakthe assertiondown into two more
specific theorems.
THEOREM8.1: Let f be a Cohn function mod N that Cohn-flipsat
arguments0-and-l, and that also Cohn-flipsat argumentsG-and-(1+G).
Cohn
Suppose that G is a generatormod N. Then f is a generator-type
function,as specifically constructedin Parts4 and 5 earlier.If N is even,
f must be two-valued.If N is odd, f may be two-valuedor three-valued.
THEOREM8.2: Let f be a Cohn function mod N that Cohn-flipsat
arguments0-and-1, and that also Cohn-flips at argumentsv-and-(l+v).
Suppose that v is not a generatormod N. Then f is an antithesis-palindrome type Cohn function, as specifically constructedin Part 7 earlier.
The numberK of that constructionis the orderof v-defined earlieras
the smallest positive integer satisfying Kv=0 mod N. (Since v is not a
generator,K will be strictly less than N.) K must be odd. K divides N
properly,and the multiples of v, mod N, are exactly the multiples of J
mod N, whereJ = (N/K). ShouldJ be greaterthan2, thenthereis a palindrome P, of length J-2, such thatconsecutive values of f at kv+2, kv+3,
.... kv+(J-2), and kv+(J-l) are the consecutive symbols of the palindrome-k being any integer from 0 to K-1 inclusive. The numberu =
(v/J) mod K is a unit mod K, and the stages of example 18 can be read
backwards,to arriveat the root function fl mod K, and thence to arrive
at the underlyingfunctionfOmod K, which simply assigns the value f(l)
to the even integersmod K, from 2 to K- inclusive, and the value f(0) to
the odd integersmod K, from 1 to K=0 inclusive.
The theoremsare given withoutproof.8
Part 9: Some directions for further work (I)
One way of expandingthe precedingwork would be to study "order
w" Cohn-flippingof functionsmod N, where w is some numbermod N.

Example 19
A function has an "orderw Cohn flip" at argumentsQ-and-(w+Q)if an
exchange of distinct(NB) functionvalues at those two w-separated(NB)
of
argumentsgives a rotatedretrograde the originalfunction.A function
is an "orderw Cohn function"if it can be orderw Cohn-flippedin two
differentways.
If w is a unit mod N, then the orderw Cohn functions are simply the
of
"circle of w transforms" ordinary(order 1) Cohn functions.The situation istrickier if w is not a unit mod N, but the mattermay still be studied by techniquessimilarto those used to performthe constructionsand
prove the theoremsof Parts4 through8 above.
Another way of expanding the work arises from Douthett's voluminous but as yet unpublishedwork on various pcset relationshipssuggested by Cohn's originalwork.We can say thatpcsets X andY arein the
"Douthettrelationof degree 1" (DOUTH1) if Y can be obtainedby discardingsome memberpitch class x of X, and then picking up some new
pitch class y one semitone away from the discardedx.9 X is then a Cohn
206

set if it is in the DOUTH relationto two distinctinvertedforms of itself.
According to Theorem4.9, X is in the DOUTH1 relationto some properly transposedform of itself if, and only if, it is a Cohn set arisingfrom
some two-valuedgenerator-type
Cohn function.
Douthett studied many generalizations of the DOUTH1 idea. For
instance, we can say thatpcsets X andY are in the "Douthettrelationof
degree 2" (DOUTH2) if Y can be obtained by discardingtwo member
pitch classes xl and x2 of X, and then picking up two new pitch classes
yl and y2, where yl lies one semitone away from the discardedxl and
y2 lies one semitone away from the discarded x2. In general, we can
study Douthett relations of arbitrarilyhigh degree D, within suitably
large "scales"mod N. But DOUTH2 is alreadyof ample interest,in the
mod 12 context;it warrants
extendedstudyin its own right.For instance,
as Douthett points out in privatecorrespondence,any pcset forming a
Tristan Chord or a dominant-seventhchord has a vast panoply of
DOUTH2-relationswith transposedand invertedforms of itself. Example 19 illustratesthese, startingfrom the chord {F,G#,B,D#}.
As we see from the left-hand column, the chord is in DOUTH2relation with its own transpositionsat levels T3, T6, and T9, pivoting
aboutits own ic3 and ic6 dyads.10Aswe see from the right-hand
column,
the chord is also in DOUTH2-relationwith six of its inverted forms,
chordsbuilt on F, G#,B, E, G, and B.11
namely the dominant-seventh
Douthett is particularlyinterestedin features of the abstractgraphs
generatedby such transitional
possibilities. Beyond abstractgraphs,contextual graphsthat arise from specific passages can be of analytic interest. Let us consider, for instance, those Tristanand dominant-seventh
chords that occur withing the first three phrasesof Tristan.They can be
listed as follows.
Chord 1: {F,B,D#,G#}
Chord2: {E,G#,D,B}
Chord3: {G#,D,F#,B)
Chord4: {G,B,F,D}
Chord5: {C,F,A6,D}
Chord6: {B,D#,A,F#}.
The following DOUTH2-relationships
obtain.
Chord 1 to any of Chords2,3,4,5,6; and vice-versa.
Chord2 to Chords4 and 5; and vice-versa.
Chord3 to Chords4,5, and 6; and vice-versa.
Chord4 to Chord5; and vice-versa.
In this scheme, Chord1, which is afterall the TristanChord,has a special and unique position: it is DOUTH2-relatedto all five of the other

in that it has the fewest numberof DOUTH2-links in the context; it is
linkedonly to Chords 1 and 3. The two most "tonallyfunctional"Chords
of the passage, Chords 2 and 6, thus have the fewest DOUTH2-links
(threeand two respectively).
Example 20 presents a suggestive way of "unfolding"the various
DOUTH2links over five successive temporalstages. The numberson the

At Stage 2 (afterwe hearChord2), thereis a perfectgraphicsymmeof

2 is destroyed, while a new symmetry arises: the line-structureof the
graphis not affected if nodes 2 and 3 are permuted,but other permutations of the nodes would change the graphicstructure.
(Forinstance,permutingnodes 1 and 2 would removethe line between node 1 and node 3,
and would introducea line between node 2 and node 3.) Stage 4 preserves and amplifies the (23) symmetry.It introducesa new symmetry
between nodes 1 and 4. If p is any permutation the symbols 1 and 4,

An interestingcomplex of DOUTH2-likerelationships
involvesforms
of the hexachord023468, a hexachordmuch used by Schoenberg-e.g.
in the WindQuintet,in VonHeute aufMorgen, and in the Violin Fantasy.
Insteadof DOUTH2 itself, we wantto invokehere the analogousrelation
thatinvolves fouths-or-fifths
insteadof semitones, thatis DOUTH2 subtransformation. shall call the new relaWe
jected to the "circle-of-fifths"
tion DOUTHCF2. Sets X and Y are in the DOUTHCF2relation if one
can discardpitchclasses xl andx2 fromX, andpick up new pitchclasses
yl and y2 to formY, in such a way thatyl is a fourthor fifthfromxl, and
y2 is a fourthor fifth from x2.
So, in example 21(a), the hexachordH = 023468 is in the relationto
its 2-transposeH2. As suggestedby the verticalunderlayof the example,
we can discardpcs 0 and 3 from H, and pick up new pcs 5 (a fifth away
from pc 0) and t (a fifth away from pc 3), so as to obtain H2. In similar
with H4, and H4 with H6, and so
fashion, H2 is in DOUTHCF2-relation
on. As one reads down the list of example 21(a), one passes througha
complete T2-cycle of hexachordforms. This cycle is similarin structure
to a Cohn cycle.
We are not yet throughwith example 21(a). It enables us to see thatH
is in the DOUTHCF2 relation with every one of its evenly-transposed
forms. Forinstance,comparethe H rankof the matrixto the H4 rank.We
see thatH4 can be obtainedfrom H if we discardpcs 2 and 3 from H and
pick up new pcs 7 and 8, a fifth away frompcs 2 and 3 respectively.Likewise we can obtainH6 from H if we discardpcs 3 and4 from H andpick

invertsH aboutthe pc 0;

the forms h2, h4, etc. are hOtransposedby T2, T4, etc. respectively.
It seems a shame thatH is not DOUTHCF2-related, well, to h6 and
as
h8. However, we can define an "extendedDOUTHCF2 relation,"EXT
DOUTHCF2, which will in fact relate H with h6 and h8 as well. The
extended relation works as follows. Given a pcset X, suppose that the
algorithmbelow can be executed.
(i) Discarda memberpc x of X.
(ii) (If possible,) pick up a fresh pc yl from the "pack"(i.e. the
complementof X), thatlies a fifth away from the discardedx.
Call the new pcset Z.
(iii) Put x back into the "pack"(i.e. the complementof Z, whence it
might be picked up again at a later stage of the algorithm).
(iv) Discarda memberpc z of Z. (We allow the possibility of choosing z=yl, of discardingthe pc selected at stage (ii) above.)
(v) (If possible,) pick up a fresh pc y2 from the "pack"(i.e. the
210

complementof Z), thatlies a fith away from the discardedz.
Call the new pcset Y.
If the algorithmcan be executed successfully, we shall say thatpcsets
X andY are in the extendedDOUTHCF2relationEXTDOUTHCF2.13
It is easily verified that DOUTHCF2-relatedsets must be EXT
DOUTHCF2-related.14 EXTDOUTHCF2 does indeed "extend"
So
DOUTHCF2. Furthermore,any pcset X-except for the total chromatic-is EXTDOUTHCF2-related itself.'5
to
Example 21(c) now shows us how hexachord H is in the EXT
DOUTHCF2relationto its evenly-invertedform h6. And example 21(d)
shows us how H is in the EXTDOUTHCF2relationto its evenly-inverted
form h8. So H is in the EXTDOUTHCF2 relation to all its evenlyinvertedforms (via example 21 (b)(c)(d)), as well as all its evenly-transposed forms (via example 21(a)).
I have yet to find a pithy short passage for analysis, from any of
Schoenberg'svariousworksinvolving hexachordH, thatworksas neatly
as the Wagneranalyses above. But I am fairly sure that some such passages exist (I should guess most likely in the Wind Quintet).Orpossibly,
the DOUTHCF2 or EXTDOUTHCF2relations might be suggestive in
analyzinglargerformalfeaturesof the works, featuresthatmight involve
a variety of excerpts from temporally non-contiguous locations in the
music.
Part 10: Some directions for further work (II)
Douthett'swork, as I partiallydescribedit and elaboratedit in Part9
above, is only one direction in which Cohn's orginal impetus can lead
onward. In the context of the present paper, I want to note that the
DOUTH2 and othersuch relationsamongpcsets can be studiedand generalizedby using thefunction model I earlierused to study and generalize Cohn's initial ideas aboutpcsets.
We can specifically extend the notion of a DOUTH2 relationbetween
pcsets, to a notion of a DOUTH2 relationbetween functions mod N, as
follows.
DEFINITION10.1: Let f and f' be functionsmod N. We shall say that
f and f' are "DOUTH2-related"
when we can find numbersm and n mod
N such thatcriteria(a) through(c) below all obtain.
(a) The four numbersm, m+1, n, and n+1 are all distinctmod N.
(b) f(m) ne f(m+l); f(n) ne f(n+l).
(c) f'(m) = f(m+l); f'(m+l) = f(m)
f'(n)= f(n+l); f'(n+l) = f(n)
f'(j) = f(j) for all other arguments mod N.
j
211

We will then be particularly interested in functions f that are
DOUTH2-related to various of their rotated ("transposed")and/or
forms. Such functionscan be investigated
("inverted")
rotated-retrograde
like those used to explore the necessary structureof
using techniques
Cohn functions,in the body of this paper.
The "extendedDOUTH2 relation"can be definedamongfunctionsas
follows.
DEFINITION10,2: Let f be a functionmod N. Suppose that the following algorithmcan be executed.
(a) Find m (if possible) so thatf(m) ne f(m+1).
(b) Define f'(m) = f(m+l); f'(m+1) = f(m);
f'(j) = f(j) for all otherj mod N.
(c) Select n (possibly = m) such that
f'(n) ne f'(n+l).
(d) Define f"(n) = f'(n+1); f"(n+1) = f(n);
f"(j) = f'(j) for all otherj mod N.
In thatcase, we shall say thatthe functionsf and f" are"EXTDOUTH2related."
As was the case with the corresponding
relationsin Part9 above, we
can show that any pair of functions that is DOUTH2-relatedis also
EXTDOUTH2-related. (So EXTDOUTH2 does indeed "extend"
DOUTH2.) And we can show that any function f is necessarily EXT
DOUTH2-related itself, so long as f has more thanone value.

And so forth.ThoughCohn's originalideas, and many of theirextensions by others, are formulatedso as to concernpcsets mod N, much of
the work can be generalizedso as to pertainto functionsmod N. Instead
of talkingabouttransposedor invertedpcsets, we then talk aboutrotated
or rotated-retrograde
functions. The conceptual focus changes: instead
of regarding the numbers mod N as objects, either set-theoretic or
embeddedin a mod N "scale,"we regardthe numbersmod N as orderpositions in a serial context where the "objects"arrangedin series can
be anything whatsoever-they are now simply the values of functions.
So far as the formal work is concerned,we need only be able to distinguish situationslike "f(j) = f(j+1)," from situationslike "f(j) ne f(j+1)."
For the formalwork, we need not concernourselves any more with what

APPENDIXA
We provide here a formal proof for Theorem 4.4, which is restated
below.
THEOREM4.4: Conditions (a) through(d) below are all logically
equivalent.Each conditionimplies all the others.
(a) G is a generatormod N.
(b) The orderof G, mod N, is N.
(c) As integers,G and N have no common divisor bigger than 1.
(d) G is a unit mod N.
We divide the proof into four sections. First we shall prove that condition (a) implies condition (b). Then we shall provethat (b) implies (c).
Then we shall prove that (d) implies (a). And finally we shall prove that
(c) implies (d). These steps entail the completelogical equivalenceof the
four conditions.
Proof that(a) implies (b): Let K be the orderof G mod N. K, as noted
earlier,is eitherequalto N or smallerthanN. The list of G-multiplesmod
N, after commencing with G,2G,3G,... ,KG=O, cycles around and
repeatswith (K+1)G = KG+G= G, (K+2)G = KG+2G= 2G, andso forth.
So the set of G-multiplesmod N comprises at most K distinct numbers
mod N. By the assumptionof condition (a), K must equal N.
Proof that (b) implies (c): Let d be a positive whole number that
divides both G and N. We write N = N'd; G =dG'. Then N'G = N'dG' =
NG' = 0 mod N. Since N'G = 0 mod N, N' is greaterthanor equal to the
order of G. But by the assumptionof (b), the order of G is N. So N',
which divides N, is also greaterthanor equalto N. It follows thatN' must
equal N, whence d must equal 1.
Proof that (d) implies (a): Since G is a unit, there is some numberv
such thatvG=1 mod N. Given any numberjmod N, the numberjvis such
that (jv)G = j(vG) = j mod N.Thus any numbermod N is some multiple
of G, as required.
The proof that (c) implies (d) is the most complex. To prove it, we
shall firstprove the following lemma.
LEMMA: Let S be any additive subgroupof the integers (positive,
negative,and zero).Assume S does not consist of zero alone. Let d be the
smallest positive numbercontainedin S. Then S comprises exactly the
variousmultiplesof d.
Proof of the lemma:Since S containsd, S containsd, d+d, d+d+d,and
so forth.S, bringa subgroup,also containsthe negativesof all those numbers. So S contains every multiple of d. We must show now that every
memberof S is a multiple of d. S being a subgroup,it suffices to show
this for every positive memberof S. Let s be a positive memberof S. Let
jd be the largestmultipleof d thatis less thanor equal to s. Then s = jd +
r, where r is some numberlying between 0 and d-1 inclusive. Now s is a
213

memberof S, andjd-being a multiple of d-is a memberof S. S being
a subgroup,the numbers-jd is a memberof S. But thatnumberis r. Thus
r is a memberof S, and r lies between 0 and d-1 inclusive. Since d is the
smallest positive member of S, then r cannot be positive. Hence r must
equal 0. And so s = jd. As desired, the sample member s of S is indeed
some multipleof d.
We can now proceed to the proof that (c) of 4.1 implies (d) of 4.1.
Given that G and N have no common divisor bigger than 1, consider the
family S of integers comprisingthose integers that can be writtenin the
form jG+kN, where j and k range throughall integers. The sum or difference of any two such integers is such an integer, so S is an additive
subgroupof integers.S containsboth G (which = 1G+ON)and N (which
= OG+1N).
Let d be the smallest positive member of S. Then, according to the
lemma, S consists precisely of all the multiples of d. So G and N, both
members of S, are both multiples of d. By the assumptionof condition
(c), d must equal 1. So 1 is a memberof S.
That means-according to the way S was defined-that the integer 1
can be writtenas jG+kN, for some integersj and k. So 1 differs fromjG
by a multiple of N. Hence jG = 1 mod N. And so G is a unit mod N, as
asserted.
