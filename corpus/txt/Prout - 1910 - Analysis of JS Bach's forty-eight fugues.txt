Middle Section. After a short episode (bar 21 to 23) there is
a group of entries by inverse movement (bars 24, 26, 28), followed
by a return to the subject in its original form and key (bar 30).
Then comes an exceptionally long episode (bars 31 to 47), leading
back, after various modulations, to the tonic key,

Besides regular entries of the subject in the

The episodes in this fugue (bars 6 to 15, 21. to 23, 31 to 47,
49 to 52, 56 to 60, 62 to 65) are extensive and of great importance,
occupying no less than 40 bars out of 71. Almost all their
thematic material

is

founded on the subject, except the theme
which is subsequently combined

in the treble of bars 35, 36,

with the subject in double counterpoint in the twelfth (see bars 48,

Counter-Exposition. After a short codetta (bars 7 to 9)
there follows a complete and very perfect counter-exposition in

bar (though the first note of the alto is shortened), while the
distance of a whole bar separates the second pair from the first.

The answer of course

leads in each pair, but as this is a higher
voice in the first pair (alto and tenor) and a lower in the other
(bass and treble) they are shown in double counterpoint.

Middle Section. The first episode (bars 12 to 16) is formed
